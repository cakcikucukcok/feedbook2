  <title>The Well of Tears - Cecilia Dart-Thornton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The beautiful maiden Jewel is the center of her parent&#39;s joy. She is the embodiment of their true love and she has grown up surrounded by peace and love in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewel&#39;s world cruelly shatters when her parents are suddenly killed and she and her uncle Eoin are forced to flee. Leaving the only home she has ever known, Jewel learns that her parents, caught in a tangle of a tragic prophecy, had hidden in the marshland for years to protect the secret knowledge that Jewel is the last of the line of the Janus Jaravhor, the dreaded sorcerer of Strang. That she might be the one person in the world who could unlock the mysterious Dome that is told to hold all of Janus&#39;s secrets. And that King Maolmordha now knows of her existence and will stop at nothing to find her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain and loss follow and Jewel must make her way alone. Rescued by a traveling band of Weathermasters, exalted magicians who control the heavens for the rich and powerful, she is taken to High Darioneth and is accepted into this tightly knit community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just accepted, but loved, for one of the young weathermasters beheld her and his heart was lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewel is left with the promise of true love and a powerful secret. But which path will she choose--and who will suffer if she makes the wrong choice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interactive CD-ROM of the world of Tir will be included in the hardcover edition of &lt;i&gt;The Well of Tears&lt;/i&gt;, which will allow the reader to enter into Dart-Thornton&#39;s creation and and experience all the wonders of this mystical and magical land. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
