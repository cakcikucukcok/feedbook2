  <title>Wake of the Bloody Angel - Alex Bledsoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, a barmaid in a harbor town fell for a young sailor who turned pirate to make his fortune. But what truly became of Black Edward Tew remains a mystery--one that has just fallen into the lap of freelance sword jockey Eddie LaCrosse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Eddie has kept his office above Angelina&#39;s tavern, so when Angelina herself asks him to find out what happened to the dashing pirate who stole her heart, he can hardly say no--even though the trail is two decades old. Some say Black Edward and his ship, &lt;i&gt;The Bloody Angel,&lt;/i&gt; went to bottom of the sea, taking with it a king&#39;s fortune in treasure. Others say he rules a wealthy, secret pirate kingdom. And a few believe he still sails under a ghostly flag with a crew of the damned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the truth, and earn his twenty-five gold pieces a day, Eddie must take to sea in the company of a former pirate queen in search of the infamous Black Edward Tew...and his even more legendary treasure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
