  <title>The Bible Repairman and Other Stories - Tim Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;2012 World Fantasy Award Winner&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In his first new collection since 2005, Tim Powers, the master of the secret history, delves into the mysteries of souls, whether they are sacrificed on the pinnacle of Mount Parnassus or lodged in a television cable box.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With two new stories and short fiction only previously available in limited editions, the cornerstone of the collection is a postscript to his harrowing novel of the haunting of the Romantic poets, The Stress of Her Regard. After Byron and Shelley break free of the succubus that claimed them, their associate, Trelawny, forges an alliance with Greek rebels to reestablish the deadly connection between man and the nephilim.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meanwhile, in a Kabbalistic story of transformation, the executor of an old friend&amp;#8217;s will is duped into housing his soul, but for the grace of the family cat. A rare-book collector replaces pennies stolen from Jean Harlow&amp;#8217;s square in the Hollywood Walk of Fame&amp;#151;and discovers a literary mystery with supernatural consequences. In a tale of time travel between 2015 and 1975, a tragedy sparked by an angel falling onto a pizza shop is reenacted&amp;#151;and the event is barely, but fatally, altered.&lt;/div&gt;" />
