  <title>The Gorgon Medusa: Book I: Herstory - Tyrone Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Medusa, synonymous with the word monster, is one of three Gorgons who possess the power to petrify any living creature. With bronze claws, a mane of venomous serpents and those deadly eyes that can snatch the life from anyone who look upon her, Medusa was ancient Greece&#39;s weapon of mass destruction. Mythology briefly told the story of the life, plight and death of the Gorgon. However it was a partial account of the being that lived over three thousand years ago. In truth, Medusa is alive today in the 21ST century! From the shadows of obscurity, she has risen to assume the guise of Madame Cynthia Petrakis: reclusive billionaire, philanthropist and humanitarian. One person, well noted archaeologist Jerimiah Clarke, stumbled upon her secret. It was a discovery that nearly ended in tragedy yet manifested into a new and true friendship. Few know of Medusa&#39;s story and now she has decided to reveal it to one man. This is Herstory!" />
