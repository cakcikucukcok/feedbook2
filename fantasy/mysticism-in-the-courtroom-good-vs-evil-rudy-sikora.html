  <title>Mysticism in the Courtroom  Good Vs. Evil - Rudy Sikora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is a fantasy. It is about the mysterious reading of the mind and projecting the truth for others to see. Sylvia Catkin and Jambriel Abdiel are two people with the same unique power, but each uses it in different ways, one for good and one for evil. The public exposure of their powers has worldwide consequences. The court system struggles with this inexplicable mind reading because the truth as the mind perceives it is revealed. We presume the testimony of witnesses is the truth, when in fact it is not. The mind reveals a contrary scenario because mind readers are able to extract the truth. Witnesses are perplexed to be told that their story is inaccurate and untrue. Attorneys and judges have a serious problem with this scenario, but acceptance would not only create a better and honest court system, it would benefit the corporate world." />
