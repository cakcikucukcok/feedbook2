  <title>The Curse of Tenth Grave - Darynda Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If one door closes and another one opens,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;your house is probably haunted. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;--Bumper Sticker &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Part-time PI and fulltime grim reaper, Charley Davidson has asked a lot of questions throughout her life: Why can I see dead people? Who is the hot supernatural entity following me? How do I get gum out of my sister&#39;s hair before she wakes up? But, &quot;How do I trap not one malevolent god, but three?&quot; was never among them. Until now. And since those gods are on earth to kill her daughter, she has little choice but to track them down, trap them, and cast them from this dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s just one problem. One of the three stole her heart a very long time ago. Can the Razer, a god of absolute death and destruction, change his omniscient spots, or will his allegiances lie with his brothers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are just a few of the questions Charley must answer, and quick. Add to that a homeless girl running for her life, an innocent man who&#39;s been charged with murdering the daughter of a degenerate gambler, and a pendant made from god glass that has the entire supernatural world in an uproar, and Charley has her hands full. If she can manage to take care of the whole world-destroying-gods thing, we&#39;re saved. If not, well...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are just some of the questions Charley must answer, and quick. Add to that a homeless girl on the run for her life, a man who&#39;s been framed for murdering a woman who is still very much alive, and a pendant made from god glass that has the entire supernatural world in an uproar, Charley has her hands full.
