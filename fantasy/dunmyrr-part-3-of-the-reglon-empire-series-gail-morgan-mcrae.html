  <title>Dunmyrr: Part 3 of The Reglon Empire Series - Gail Morgan McRae</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since we first met Dr. Simon Slogar, REG Commander Michael Camdus, the Wizard Vandalen, and the subspace particle Rider Rax&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Creedor,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;their worlds have been thrown into one calamity after another. The epidemic on Creedor is stopped and the rogue trizactl mine purged of Q&amp;#39;Arons, but they are left with the knowledge that the Q&amp;#39;Arons have taken massive amounts of this precious mineral in what they consider an act of war. Along the way, the reader meets Mara Tonlin who successfully finds her husband Ram Tonlin, or more accurately, he finds her. With Mara and Lieutenant Jacar Grunden&amp;nbsp;(the soldier who helps her look for her husband)&amp;nbsp;safe again, Camdus knows that he must go back and retrieve the trizactl, thus ending&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Creedor&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and setting us up for part 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Hellritch&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;continues the action when the Queen and her daughter&amp;nbsp;makes a daring escape. But they don&amp;#39;t make it to their destination. Instead, they wind up on Reglon Minor at the military base camp there. The curious princess and her friend manage Pan to get lost in the woods and then&amp;nbsp;taken by the Q&amp;#39;Arons, who release the boy. In a brilliant move, their resident chaun Redmond transforms himself as a decoy. Redmond and an armed escort go into the enchanted woods on the pretext of finding Amielle, but in reality are looking for a way to infiltrate the Q&amp;#39;Aron ranks. Cloaked and armed, they succeed only to find that Hellritch, the grotesque Q&amp;#39;Aron emperor, intends to make Alora his queen and Amielle a courtesan. In a surprise move, Reglon Emperor Jarlod leads a rescue mission. The Slogar children, all changelings, jump into the battle. Jarlod realizes that he has been tricked. He orders Amielle returned from the military base camp on Reglon Minor&amp;nbsp;to the palace to marry Lord Harvich. Finally, in fear of his father-in-law King Eldreth, he&amp;nbsp;requests the queen&amp;#39;s return. When Camdus sends Rax to Q&amp;#39;Door Hold where she&amp;#39;s been under the watchful eye of Captain Victor Slag, the Rider returns without either of them. They are gone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Hellritch&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;ends with&amp;nbsp;Jarlod furious and Camdus facing a new problem: find Queen Alora.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Dunmyrr&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;takes the reader along on the search for Alora&amp;nbsp;to Earth, where the ancestors of the Reglon Empire came from. There they will meet some of the most evil, bizarre beings imaginable. Enchantments of dark magic threaten Serin, who has already been cursed (or blessed) by magic. Now, in the forest around Dunmyrr, he steps into such dark magic that he finds the&amp;nbsp;life being sapped from him. But his isn&amp;#39;t the only wicked enchantment. The evil god Moloch tries to take a little girl named Lizzie and&amp;nbsp;kill her grandfather, Lemm, but is unsuccessful. Marie, his wife, finds them, thanks to a lizard named Arol. But Lizzie is nonresponsive. The witch Elga who shows up throughout the series holds the key to both these problems, but getting her to help takes a bit of trickery, first by Serin himself, and later by Rax.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Dunmyrr&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;takes a military leader from each of the empires and juxtaposes them in a situation where it is beneficial for them to work together for the better of both empires. Paraphrasing&amp;nbsp;Camdus, they don&amp;#39;t have to be friends to want peace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
