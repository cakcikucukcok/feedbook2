  <title>Birds of a Feather - Clara M. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BIRDS OF A FEATHER, is the third in an ongoing series of books about the rivalry of two brothers: Michael the Archangel and his exiled sibling, Lucifer. In volume three, we follow the lives of two young men mentioned in the other books. The book traces the violent history of Mitch Garfield, a former Marine and espionage agent and the rather more sedate life of Todd Bechtold, raised in Hollywood and more at home with art and music that violence. Nevertheless, inexorably, these two are drawn together and, serendipitously, wind up in Scajaquada where the battle between the two brothers is being waged. The backgrounds of both men serve to prepare them for their part in this battle and their courage and resilience under enormous pressure surprises even them. Though Mitch, as the apparently stronger of the two, assumes the role of protector to his younger mate, he soon learns that Todd has strength he, himself, lacks. The strength of both will be needed and tested when Lucifers ongoing campaign to initiate The Rule of Chaos on Earth begins to heat up with Mitch and Todd caught in the middle. How they handle this ongoing threat to mankind remains to be seen as future volumes will show.
	Despite the subject matter, this series is NOT religious, though it does contain religious elements and characters, casting many in a new light.
	As the story opens, Mitch is still a High School student with hopes of making something of himself. Fate intervenes, however, and the young man finds himself in a role thats foreign to him. As Mitch fights his way through Korea, a young man named Todd is growing up in Hollywood--hostile and disillusioned. While Todd attends College and meets some rather amazing people, Mitch winds up in the inferno of Vietnam where he and the unflappable Captain Truckner meet an uncompromising fate. Both the soldier and the art aficionado, however, receive help and guidance from a strange source: Mitch through a mysterious Phantom Soldier who twice saves him from death and Todd through the unlikely agency of a Voodoo priestess.
	These two disparate individuals finally come together and realize they are soul-mates. Their union leads them to Scajaquada and a rendezvous with destiny.....and Lucifer." />
