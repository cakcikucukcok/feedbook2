  <title>Intertwined (An Intertwined Story, Book 1) - Gena Showalter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Most sixteen-year-olds have friends. Aden Stone has four human souls inside him: One can time-travel. One can raise the dead. One can tell the future. And one can possess another human. With no family and a life spent in and out of institutions, Aden and the souls have become friends. But now they&#39;re causing him all kinds of trouble.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Like, he&#39;ll blink and suddenly he&#39;s a younger Aden, reliving the past. Or he&#39;ll walk past a total stranger and know how she&#39;s going to die. He&#39;s so over it. All he wants is peace. And then he meets a girl who quiets the voices. Why? Mary Ann Gray is his total opposite. For her sake, he should stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s too late. . . . Somehow, they share an inexplicable friendship. A bond about to be tested by a werewolf who wants Mary Ann, and a vampire princess Aden can&#39;t resist. Two romances, both forbidden. Still, the four will enter a dark underworld of intrigue and danger–but not everyone will come out alive. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
