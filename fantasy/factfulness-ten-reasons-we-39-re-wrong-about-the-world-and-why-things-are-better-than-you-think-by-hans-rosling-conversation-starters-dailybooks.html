  <title>Factfulness: Ten Reasons We&#39;re Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Factfulness: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ten Reasons We&amp;#39;re Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;by Hans Rosling | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Biases and distorted perspectives cause people to create divisions and antipathies between groups. They also distort the way we perceive information from the media. We don&amp;rsquo;t know that there are many things we are ignorant of. Our seemingly intelligent guesses are based on unconscious biases. &amp;nbsp;It is because humans are naturally born to crave for drama and are easily deluded into making non-factual decisions. Hans Rosling shows us how to be factful and make intelligent decisions that will make us optimistic about the world&amp;rsquo;s future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rosling is renowned for his highly popular TED talks which have been viewed 35 million times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Explore&lt;/b&gt; unseen realms of the book as never seen before" />
