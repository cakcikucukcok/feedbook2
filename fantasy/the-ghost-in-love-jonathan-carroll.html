  <title>The Ghost in Love - Jonathan Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I envy anyone who has yet to enjoy the sexy, eerie, and addictive novels of Jonathan Carroll. They are delicious treats--with devilish tricks inside them.&quot;--Michael Dirda, The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Gaiman has written: &quot;Jonathan Carroll has the magic. He&#39;ll lend you his eyes, and you&#39;ll never see the world in quite the same way ever again.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the luminous and marvelously inventive world of &lt;i&gt;The Ghost in Love&lt;/i&gt;. A man falls in the snow, hits his head on a curb, and dies. But something strange occurs: the man &lt;i&gt;doesn&#39;t &lt;/i&gt;die, and the ghost that&#39;s been sent to take his soul to the afterlife is flabbergasted. Going immediately to its boss, the ghost asks, what should I do now? The boss says, we don&#39;t know how this happened but we&#39;re working on it. We want you to stay with this man to help us figure out what&#39;s going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ghost agrees unhappily; it is a ghost, not a nursemaid. But a funny thing happens--the ghost falls madly in love with the man&#39;s girlfriend, and things naturally get complicated. Soon afterward, the man discovers he did not die when he was &quot;supposed&quot; to because for the first time in their history, human beings have decided to take their fates back from the gods. It&#39;s a wonderful change, but one that comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ghost in Love &lt;/i&gt;is about what happens to us when we discover that we have become the masters of our own fate. No excuses, no outside forces or gods to blame--the responsibility is all our own. It&#39;s also about love, ghosts that happen to be gourmet cooks, talking dogs, and picnicking in the rain with yourself at twenty different ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen King has said that &quot;Jonathan Carroll is as scary as Hitchcock, when he isn&#39;t being as funny as Jim Carrey.&quot; Jonathan Lethem sees Carroll as the &quot;master of sunlit surrealism.&quot; However one regards this beguiling original, two facts are indisputable: It&#39;s tough being a ghost on an empty stomach. And &lt;i&gt;The Ghost in Love &lt;/i&gt;is a triumphant return.&lt;/p&gt;" />
