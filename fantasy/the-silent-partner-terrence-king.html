  <title>The Silent Partner - Terrence King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Homer, a bold and smart-mouthed angel, has been in isolation for nine-hundred years. She misbehaves and tests the boundaries of God, which was what put her in isolation in the first place. She doesn&#39;t like the simpering League of Angels members, especially Gabriel--she has no place for such a goody two-shoes--and she doesn&#39;t trust God and cares little what anyone thinks of her. Despite her fussiness and track record of failure, she&#39;s sent to Earth to do what needs to be done.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
Her mission is to help Tom summers, a struggling columnist for an expanding magazine empire in Los Angeles--to Homer, the epicenter of Western egocentrism and inauthenticity. She must help him publish a book that would ultimately change Earth&#39;s fate. Unsure how to accomplish her task, she wants more of God&#39;s help or for Him to send Tom a sign, but always a stickler for free will, God won&#39;t let her interfere with humanity. Still, it&#39;s up to her to save the world, she believes God is against her, and time is ticking. No pressure.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
Left to her own devices, Homer wonders whether humanity is worth saving. She believes humans to be violent, self-centered brats. Earth itself is a trash heap, already polluted by all of God&#39;s chosen people. Is there anything left to save? Tom, along with some other eccentric Earth-walkers, might change her perspective, but in the end, the fate of the world rests in Homer&#39;s angelic hands.&lt;p&gt;" />
