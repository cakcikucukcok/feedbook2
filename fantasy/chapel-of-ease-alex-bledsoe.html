They soon become friends; Matt learns that Ray&#39;s people call themselves the Tufa and that the musical is based on the history of his isolated home town. But there is one question in the show&#39;s script that Ray refuses to answer: what is buried in the ruins of the chapel of ease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As opening night approaches, strange things begin to happen. A dreadlocked girl follows Ray and spies on him. At the press preview, a strange Tufa woman warns him to stop the show.

He also hopes, while he&#39;s there, to find out more of the real story behind the play and discover the secret that Ray took to his grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&#39;s journey into the haunting Appalachian mountains of Cloud County sets him on a dangerous path, where some secrets deserve to stay buried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enter the captivating world of the fae in Alex Bledsoe&#39;s Tufa novels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hum and the Shiver&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wisp of a Thing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Long Black Curl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chapel of Ease&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gather Her Round&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
