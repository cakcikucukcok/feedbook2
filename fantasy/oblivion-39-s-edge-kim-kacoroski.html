Suddenly, she must acknowledge the reality of a multidimensional world. Once through the looking glass, Joan cultivates the knack for seeing behind the veil of existence without going beyond the edge. In this liminal zone, she finds new friends and loves from a realm she never before knew existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to all these life-changing events, she develops a relationship with Donna and Carrie.
