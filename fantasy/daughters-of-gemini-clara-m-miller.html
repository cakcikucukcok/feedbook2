  <title>Daughters of Gemini - Clara M. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daughters of Gemini, the seventh book in the Brothers Series and the third in the Shamrocks Saga, continues the story begun in Shamrocks in the Heather and continuing in A Breath of Old Smoke. It tells of the ongoing adventures of Martin Boland Quigley, his wife Anne and their growing family..
	The story begins when the Quigley twins, Theodora and Theodosia are merely six months old and their beloved brother, Roarke, four years old. As they grow, it seems the tension and war-clouds in Europe grow with them. Once again, the family is summoned to aid the mysterious group known as RISK in assessing the situation in Germany. And, once again, they are threatened with diabolical enemies as well as the rapidly expanding Nazi party. Now that Martins link to the Spear of Destiny has been revealed, Lucifer must do everything he can to keep him away from the powerful artifact. The Prince of Hell looks forward to the day that Adolph Hitler will use the Spear to initiate his greatest wish: The Rule of Chaos. He does manage to separate Martin and his closest ally, his son Roarke. But Lucifer fails to take into account the abilities of the twins. In spite of proof to the contrary, he continues to denigrate the worth of females and ignores the danger of the Quigleys Guardian Angels.
	Since Conor first discovered he had a Guardian Angel who was more than willing to talk to him, the Angels have played a growing part in the lives of all the Quigleys. With the war looming and the male members of the family approaching maturity, the Angels are soon to be overworked and tempted to disobey the rule that they must render no direct aid. 
	This is not a religious book nor meant to endorse or promote any type of belief. It is intended to provide a verbal roller-coaster ride. Plus, Ive grown to quite like The Old Man. Enjoy!" />
