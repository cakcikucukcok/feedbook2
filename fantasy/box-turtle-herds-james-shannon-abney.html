  <title>Box Turtle Herds - James Shannon Abney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Fairies and elves have been a part of folk lore for as long as stories have been told. Some of the great mysteries in life growing up can never be fully
    explained with any certainty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The answers to questions many children growing up have about Santa Claus and who he is, rests with with these mythical creatures. The Santa Claus
    Chronicles are stories about Santa that only the elves know. They explain who he is, what he does and why.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The Box Turtle Herds is the 2nd of 26 stories told to a young boy by an elf he happens across in the woods. You will discover that Santa was one of the
    three wise men told of in the Bible. That he delivered the very first Christmas present over 2,000 years ago to the child that it is named after.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Santa does not do his life&#39;s work alone. His wife Martha and the industrious little elves that help him, know that the hope of the world lies with all the
    children of the world.
