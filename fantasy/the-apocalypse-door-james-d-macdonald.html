  <title>The Apocalypse Door - James D. Macdonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Peter Crossman is a man with a mission . . . and his boss is literally out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His world is a dangerous place . . . and it&#39;s Peter Crossman&#39;s job to protect it. Men of the cloth can only do so much. Against ancient evils, you need the ancient strength of faith. That&#39;s where Peter Crossman, Knight Templar in modern America, comes in. Crossman&#39;s world is yours and mine. Governments and businesses squabble, people go out for coffee, folks meet and fall in love, and the Red Sox will win the World Series when Hell freezes over. But that last just might happen if Crossman doesn&#39;t get his latest assignment right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Apocalypse Door&lt;/i&gt; is a spy story with a truly unique twist. On a routine mission from his order to discover the whereabouts of some missing UN peacekeepers, Peter Crossman discovers a plot that points to the uncovering of a very unholy artifact. An object of such power that it might very well open a portal to damnation and beyond, bringing some unsavory people a whole lot of power . . . or bring about the destruction of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the unlooked-for aid of Sister Mary Magdalene of the Special Action Executive of the Poor Clares, Peter Crossman will begin a journey to try and track down just what is being unleashed in the world and try like hell to stop it . . . or maybe stopping Hell here on Earth is more like it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, fortunately, demonic magic isn&#39;t the only source of Power in the world . . . and Peter Crossman&#39;s power comes from Above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Apocalypse Door&lt;/i&gt; is a smart, funny, and sexy spy caper with a touch of the sacred from a very talented writer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You like Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Or want to be her?&lt;br&gt;Then&lt;i&gt; The Apocalypse Door&lt;/i&gt; is for you. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
