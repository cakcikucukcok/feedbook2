  <title>The Golden Eagle and the Fiddle of Doom: 2 Protectors of Weapons - Fergal Joe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is about a man called Rhymes Ramose and the way he tried to destroy the world after a man called King Hovercraft killed his sister Hanneck Ramose.  It also tells the story about how people tried to stop him from destroying the world for Rhymes Ramose holds the rest of us responsible for his sisters death. 
This is the second book in the series the way the last story began. 
The story begins when a plane crashes in a desert.  The pilot asks a man called Captain John Coiners why a ship is left in the desert.  The pilots name is Keith Black.  John tells him that he was the captain of the ship and that the ship is called the Red Dragon.  He also tells him the history about how they found the Fiddle of Doom and that his son Michael burnt a Golden Eagle and that Michael was put into prison.  He tells Keith that he would do anything for his son.  
He tells Keith Black about a man called Treeon Littlewood and the story that he told him and the crew of the Red Dragon. 
The way the first book ended and the way the second book begins. 
Thousand Boil meets The Black Knight and everyone from the Underworld heads off to Africa to try and find the weapons that are buried in a Mountain called Mount Kina.  Rhymes Ramose and his army have come to earth and are starting to take out the human race.  They also meet a prince called Prince Indiana Jones who is the son of King Dave Jones.  King Dave Jones has gone with Thousand Boil and his army to Africa.  When they get there they meet up with two giants, their names are Big-foot and Horses-ash.  They are the keepers of the gates and the protectors of weapons.  
They are standing outside Mount Kina and they are there to stop people from taking the weapons out of Mount Kina.  However when they hear that the Black Knight is with Thousand Boil they let some of Thousand Boils army walk into the mountain.  As soon as Thousand Boil sees the weapons he and his men take them out of the mountain and the story begins. 
You might be wondering where this story came from.  Well I will tell you.  It came into my head after I was watching a program called Horizons.  On the program I heard them talking about a desert that turns into a sea every now and again.  So I thought to myself if a desert can turn into a sea then why not have a sea turn into a desert?  Then I thought to myself, why would anyone want to go to a place like that?  So I thought what if someone had burnt a rare bird like a golden eagle and was put into prison and the only way that they could get out was for someone else to find one to replace the one that was burnt.  
So I started to write the story then I thought it would be really boring telling a story like that.  Then the Lord of the Rings came out and I got my thinking cap on and thought instead of having a ring with power why not have a fiddle with the power to take an immortals soul.  
Then I started thinking what would be the best way to start to tell the story of the history of the fiddle of Doom so I decided to have it placed in a cave and for one of the crew of the Red Dragon to play it.  Then I thought, why not have an immortal to tell the history behind the fiddle of Doom?  Then along came Treeon Littlewood to tell the story.  
So I hope you like the story for if you do I will write another one for I am hoping to write three books on this subject.  It has taken me about two years to write this story so I would like for someone to buy it so that my work will not be in vain.  I would also like people to tell me what they think of it." />
