  <title>Beth&#39;s Journey - Peggy Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beths Journey is a tale of courage and strength of the human spirit.  In a writing style that is clean, simple, and beautifully authentic, author Peggy Williamsons narrator is Beth herself.  Beth is a teen age girl who lives on the family homestead in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia.  She and her brother were orphaned when she was sixteen, and they join a wagon train headed to Oregon.  
	Beth and Newitt were taught well by their parents, and are up to the challenges of the rugged trail westward.   Williamson provides the readers with vividly depicted details of the rigors and dangers faced by pioneers who traversed the Oregon Trail.  Heat, storms, mountains, rivers, exhaustion, and illness plague them, but it is the brutal Indian attack that ultimately tests Beth to the limits of her endurance.  
	Beths Journey is a tribute to our heritage, and a researched, but fictional view of our American experience during the period of time." />
