The true Mysterians, innately endowed with the power to manipulate reality, were displaced eons ago by the subworlders with whom they shared their magical teachings, and written out of the reality&amp;#160;pattern of their own world. For years they have lived in exile in the subworld of Trelari, shielded&amp;#160;from the Mysterian pursuit led by Moregoth and the Sealers.
