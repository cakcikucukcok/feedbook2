  <title>The Magical Stone Cottage - Shirley Cochran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Magical Stone Cottage&quot; is the story of Anna who, on the day her mother died, finds herself in a strange cottage where her deceased father talks to her about the mysteries of life and death and explains that we never really lose those we love.  When Anna leaves the cottage, she discovers that she is able to see the world of little people, fairies, angels, and spirits.  She finds work as a maid and begins to sketch and then paint the special world she sees and becomes successful as she experiences an ever expanding awareness of a special world beyond that experienced by most.  The story follows Anna through love, loss, and difficult decisions as she learns to trust her own instincts and allow herself to be guided by her own inner self and the beings from this other world.  Anna learns that each of us has a purpose and our lives are the product of the choices we make as we work within a plan greater than ourselves.  It is a book of magic and hope for anyone who has ever wondered why we are here and believes there is something more to life than random chance." />
