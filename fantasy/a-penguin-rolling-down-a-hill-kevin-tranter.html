  <title>A Penguin Rolling Down a Hill - Kevin Tranter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Penguin Rolling Down a Hill is a young adult/crossover fantasy adventure set in a land where the dreams we have at night, while we are sleeping, are actually produced and performed. 
Up near the Zenith Territory lies the magnificent Palace of Somnium. Ever since the beginning of time, the palace has been the residence of the dream ambassador, Mr. Good, and the place where all the nice, pleasant, happy dreams were conceived. 
Vile, another dream ambassador who specializes in nightmares, did all his scary stuff down in the Nether Regions in a dark and gloomy place called Torment Towers. 
All that was, until recently. 
With the advent of 3D computer-animated dreams up at the palace, Vile found himself lagging behind in the technology stakes. 
And he didnt like it. 
So he marched over to the palace and kicked Mr. Goods butt out. Vile is now in total control of Dream World, and everyone, everywhere, every night faces the prospect of horrible nightmaresnightmares that will lead to stress, anxiety, depression, and lack of sleep all across the world. 
The consequences could very well be catastrophic. 
Vile must be stopped, and Mr. Good has a plan. He calls for help from the physical world. But can two sixth-form students really save the world?" />
