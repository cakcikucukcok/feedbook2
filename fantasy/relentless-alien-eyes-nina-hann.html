  <title>Relentless Alien Eyes - Nina Hann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Byron wondered why the beautiful Margaux seemed so different? What is it that makes her so special and alluring. Why can&#39;t he stop thinking about her? A mysterious loner, she had already made it clear that she was not interested in romance, but that did not deter him from trying to pursue her. Eventually, the star-crossed lovers fall deeply in love only to be separated by a chance encounter with a blinding, white light from above. Several years later, they cross paths with each other. And yet, Margaux, still traumatized and confused by her memories of the huge, dark eyes, made it all the more difficult for Byron to rekindle their love, a love that never really faded with time. As Margaux and Byron grew closer together, they soon found themselves haunted by the inexplicable secrets of their past. Secrets that will ultimately change their lives." />
