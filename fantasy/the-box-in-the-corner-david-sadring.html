  <title>The Box in the Corner - David Sadring</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rex and Amy lived a peaceful, God-fearing life in the little town of Elk Valley, raising their two children to be moral, upright citizens in a world on the verge of war. Elk Valley was an idyllic place, far from the violence of big cities and troubled politics. Yet, even in the quietest of worlds, war can bloom. One morning, Rex awoke with a strange sense of forebodingsomething was not right in his peaceful world.
That fateful day, bombs fell on Elk Valley, as a New World Order brought chaos to planet Earth. Rex lost more than his home; he lost his wife, his daughter, and his son in the devastating blast. Suddenly, Rexs world and the world of the humanity were in uproar as an apocalypse descended with hefty consequence. Rebuilding was necessary to survive, but how could Rex rebuild when everything he loved was so completely lost to him?
It would take a miracle to bring Rex back from the brink, yet his faith grounded him in the world of the living. His prayers brought light to the darkness, and God was there to show him the necessary path back to life. Rexs response to personal tragedy shapes the leader he is destined to become. Through respect, honor, and compassion, Rex finds purpose, and a divine visitor gives him the ultimate strength to carry on in a world drowning in malevolence." />
