      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Poor Penny Lanethe afterlife just isnt getting any easier. She has barely had time to recover from her grueling life lesson (let alone her own murder) and a brutal course in mortal mapping. She now finds herself thrown unexpectedly into her craziest mission yet. The aliens are at it again, fighting a civil war that threatens to tear their society apartas surely as the tremors, fires, and other instigated disasters menace their separate afterlife world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Roy, the cowboy archangel, has a plan. He has gathered a select army of humans, aliens, and angels to bring peace to this embattled world. They seek to settle the dispute between the warrior aliens and their weaker counterparts and to subdue the powers of their tyrant leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with every friend she has made since her murder, Penny is reunited with her ghost retrieval team, including the handsome and charismatic Avery and the groovy archangel, Eric, for a mission that is equal parts unique and dangerous. The humans and angels are forced to venture out across a mysterious and unpredictable landscapethe once-experimental and ancient plane of existence of the Titans and Olympians. In &lt;i&gt;Ancient Gods and the Angel Caf&lt;/i&gt;, Penny Lanes chaotic yet hope-filled journey continues, and this time, she is sharing her epic adventure with all of her favorite fellow adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
