  <title>Step into My World - A. Gedman, Stephen Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You are to blame, Jan!
These tales are based on stories I used to tell my daughter when she was a little girl. When she grew up and went to university, we were talking on the phone one night, and she asked if I would write her some of those stories. ( I like to think she was missing her old dad. ) Of course, I beefed them up to teenage standard. This absolutely took me over, and she was loving them too.
So here they are, with a little extra meat on em, hopefully to reach a broader spectrum of you mugs! If you spend hard-earned cash on this, then as the Steele clan would say: serves you glad!
Luv yah, Petal.
Dad, XXXOXXX
PS: You will be introduced to Brad, my eldest baby, to meet my youngest baby go to (verbalvigilantemusic.com). Jode awaits you.
Sadly, their mum, Christine, and I decided we no longer needed each other and went our separate ways a few years ago. I still have deep feelings for you, Chris, just in a different way.
