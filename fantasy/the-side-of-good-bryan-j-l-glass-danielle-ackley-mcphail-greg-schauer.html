  <title>The Side of Good - Bryan J.L. Glass, Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Greg Schauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in a century not too long ago, we all recognized what a hero looked like. What they did. Why they did it. Once upon a time, we were more concerned with discovering the secret of who they were, than what their weakness was or what mistakes they may have made.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People need heroes. They need to remember what it is to stand up for the little guy, the oppressed, those preyed upon by others. They need to remember that one person can make a difference and it needn&amp;rsquo;t be about superpowers or expensive gadgets&amp;mdash;though we happen to think those things are great&amp;mdash;but about the willingness to step forward, put on that spandex suit, and say &amp;ldquo;not today, Evil, not today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People need an example to live by. They need hope.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We would like to remind you of that bygone era of heroic figures doing what is right because it needs to be done, from the small things to the large, with no need for reward and knowing the cost may be sacrifice. But more important yet, let us remind you that one need not risk life and limb to be heroic, to make another&amp;rsquo;s life better. Open these pages and watch these tales unfold, then take them with you into the day-to-day, and ask yourself: In what way can I be a hero today?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With stories by comic book and literary masters:&amp;nbsp;Bryan J.L. Glass, Robert Greenberger, Gail Z. Martin and Larry N. Martin, James Chambers, Walt Ciechanowski,&amp;nbsp;John L. French, and Kathleen David&amp;nbsp;this collection is guaranteed to be super.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Featuring a never-before-published Furious(TM) short story!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NOTE: This book paired&amp;nbsp;with The Side of Evil (B016X95RC2) make up&amp;nbsp;the print book The Side of Good / The Side of Evil (978-1942990031)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
