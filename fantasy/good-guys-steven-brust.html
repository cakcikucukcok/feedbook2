For jaywalking, supposedly. Actually, for arguing with a cop while black. Four of the nine shots were lethal--or would have been, if their target had been anybody else. The Foundation picked him up, brought him back, and trained him further. &quot;Lethal&quot; turns out to be a relative term when magic is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Marci was fifteen, she levitated a paperweight and threw it at a guy she didn&#39;t like. The Foundation scooped her up for training too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hippie chick&quot; Susan got well into her Foundation training before they told her about the magic, but she&#39;s as powerful as Donovan and Marci now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can teleport themselves thousands of miles, conjure shields that will stop bullets, and read information from the remnants of spells cast by others days before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all work for the secretive Foundation...for minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is okay, because the Foundation are the good guys. Aren&#39;t they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
