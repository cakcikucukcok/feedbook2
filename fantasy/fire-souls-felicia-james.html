  <title>Fire Souls - Felicia James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One year ago, twenty-three-year-old Haleys heart was shattered by the tragic death of her parents. A child of the bayou, she seeks solace in the dark, comforting shadows of her childhood home. There, things make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least they used to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late one evening, Haley encounters a strange and beautiful creature in her dreams. She is stunned by the terrifying glory of his pearled black wings and ashen skin, but it is his eyes that have stolen her will to escape. Deep within the mysteries of the diamond eyes of this fallen angel, she knows she is home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pragmatic woman who does not believe in the seductive magic that swirls inescapably throughout her hometown of New Orleans, Haley brushes the dream offbut she cant stop thinking about him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in New Orleans, another life is distracted by dreams of an impossibly beautiful young woman with rich, raven hair and a sad, wounded soul. In all of his immortal years, the angel-vampire Luke has never seen someone so lovely and so broken. He knows her name is Haley, and he is helpless in his attraction to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two dreams become a glorious reality, and love is their reward. When he offers her immortality at his side, she must make the biggest decision of her life. Should she let her mortal life go to be with him? Is she willing to pay the terrible price for eternity at his side?&lt;/p&gt;" />
