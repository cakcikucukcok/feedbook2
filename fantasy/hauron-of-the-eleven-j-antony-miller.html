  <title>Hauron of the Eleven - J. Antony Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hauron of the Eleven is the second novel in the Shaylae Trilogy. It begins on the planet Yurob, the home of Dark Ones, and runs concurrently with the events on Earth recorded in Shaylae of the Gentle Heart. 
Hauron is a slave and has just begun his servitude in the lithium mines and will more than likely be dead by the time he reaches his fortieth birthday. However, there is something unusual about Hauronhe has visions in which he sees events back on Earth. In particular he has just witnessed Shaylaes first encounter with the Dark Ones. He is terrified that the ruling class of Yurob will kill him and probably his family if these powers are discovered.
Hauron is brought before First Prophet and the Council of The Eleven. Fearing he will be put to death he is surprised to learn that First Prophet needs him. It appears that Hauron may have more power, particularly when it comes to seeing events on Earth, than any other member of the ruling council. Hauron is accepted into the ruling classes over the objections of some members of The Eleven. Haurons power increases as he is educated in the ways of the Dark Ones until he becomes Second of The Eleven, second only to First Prophet. 
While he has very little in common with the rulers of Yurob, Hauron does believe that Shaylae is the reincarnated Asdzn Ndleeh, the one who destroyed Yurob three-thousand years earlier. Hauron intends to use his power and new position to bring significant changes to life on Yurob  and improving the working conditions and social standing of the slaves.
Four years later Shaylae visits Yurob and meets Hauron and together they plot the downfall of the ruling classes. What neither of them has realized is that one of the members of the Council of Eleven, Denab, is significantly more than he seems and has an agenda of his own. It will take all of Shaylaes power combined with the powers of Micah and Ayanna to defeat this new foe, although each of them will first have to face him alone." />
