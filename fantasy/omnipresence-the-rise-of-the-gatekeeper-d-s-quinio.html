  <title>Omnipresence: The Rise of the Gatekeeper - D. S.  Quinio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The eternal existence of the Universe rests on three orbs. One was stolen and the other two are in peril. The Orbs of Power were created when the world was young to sustain life. Each contains the forces within the Maker&#39;s innate self: Omnipresence, Omniscience, and Omnipotence. When the Orb of Omnipresence fractures and explodes as the Archangel fights the Demon attempting to steal it, the fragments fall and scatter between Earth and the realm of Dyrg&#39;Or, causing both dimensions to merge and fight for space, and the shards to latch on to the mortals below. Kyle Drummond never expects an ordinary day in his native Toronto to end with an unlikely catastrophe. When he regains consciousness after a terrifying lightning bolt strikes him, he finds himself in a strange habitat with an archangel and a maiden from an unknown land. Kyle realizes that everything he knew about himself is just the tip of what he is destined to be. Freija, an erudite from Dyrg&#39;Or, has remained a maiden all her life until she finds love with shy Kyle. Yet if they succeed in finding the scattered orb fragments and manage to put the balance back on Earth and Dyrg&#39;Or, she is doomed to never see him again. This is the first book of The Orbs of Power series. It tells how a guileless mortal transcends to become The Gatekeeper, and the journey that defines his destiny." />
