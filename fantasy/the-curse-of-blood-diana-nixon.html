  <title>The Curse of Blood - Diana Nixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the mysterious world of magic, where nothing is what it seems, only blood never lies. It binds generations, endowing their descendants with powers and knowledge. Sometimes it heals, and sometimes, it becomes a curse that turns you into someone you never wanted to be... Eileen and her friends did their best to destroy the Dragons brotherhood, one of the most dangerous organizations that ever existed. Could they have imagined how bad the consequences of their actions would be? Now, they are forced to watch one of their friends die. If only Evan were not bound to Eileen and Amanda, who will have to go through the hell of his death with him... But what if death could be just an illusion? An illusion where every step you take brings you closer to the new life where nothing will ever be the same... Will the powers of love and magic be enough to survive?.. Or will destroying the world of supernatural become the only way to keep their hearts beating?." />
