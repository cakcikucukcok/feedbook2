  <title>American Gods - Neil Gaiman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The storm was coming&amp;#8230;.Shadow spent three years in prison, keeping his head down, doing his time.  All he wanted was to get back to the loving arms of his wife and to stay out of trouble for the rest of his life.  But days before his scheduled release, he learns that his wife has been killed in an accident, and his world becomes a colder place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   On the plane ride home to the funeral, Shadow meets a grizzled man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday.  A self-styled grifter and rogue, Wednesday offers Shadow a job.  And Shadow, a man with nothing to lose accepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But working for the enigmatic Wednesday is not without its price, and Shadow soon learns that his role in Wednesday&#39;s schemes will be far more dangerous than he ever could have imagined.  Entangled in a world of secrets, he embarks on a wild road trip and encounters, among others, the murderous Czernobog, the impish Mr. Nancy, and the beautiful Easter -- all of whom seem to know more about Shadow than he himself does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shadow will learn that the past does not die, that everyone, including his late wife, had secrets, and that the stakes are higher than anyone could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All around them a  storm of epic proportions threatens to break.  Soon Shadow and Wednesday will be swept up into a conflict as old as humanity itself.  For beneath the placid surface of everyday life a war is being fought -- and the prize is the very soul of America.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As unsettling as it is exhilarating, &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt; is a dark and kaleidoscopic journey deep into myth and across an America at once eerily familiar and utterly alien.  Magnificently told, this work of literary magic will haunt the reader far beyond the final page.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>American Gods - Neil Gaiman</i></b> | American Gods (2001) is a fantasy novel by British author Neil Gaiman. The novel is a blend of Americana, fantasy, and various strands of ancient and modern mythology, all centering on the mysterious and taciturn Shadow. The book was published in 2001 by Headline in the United Kingdom and by William Morrow in the United States.<br /><b><i>American Gods - Wikipedia</i></b> | Neil Gaiman  is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of more than twenty books, including Norse Mythology, Neverwhere, and The Graveyard Book. Among his numerous literary awards are the Newbery and Carnegie medals, and the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, and Will Eisner awards. Originally from England, he now lives in America.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition ...</i></b> | American Gods is Neil Gaiman's best and most ambitious novel yet, a scary, strange, and hallucinogenic road-trip story wrapped around a deep examination of the American spirit. Gaiman tackles everything from the onslaught of the information age to the meaning of death, but he doesn't sacrifice the razor-sharp plotting and narrative style he's been delivering since his Sandman days.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>American Gods - Neil Gaiman</a> </h3></p><hr/>
