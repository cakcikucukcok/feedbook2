  <title>Lord of the Everdark - Christopher Hazell-Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A razors edge upon which balances the fate of Everything. For Che-Avana, home seems further away than ever, drawn ever more into maintaining the delicate peace between Men and Elves. For Castanaea enemies are stalking her every footstep, eroding her power, stealing away her Empire and talking of war. But caught in the squabbles and politics of elves and men, none notice the growing shadow of the majik and the corruption it spreads. None see the dark minds manipulating events to their own ends, and none foresee the destruction that the return of the majik will bring. Will Castanaea and Che-Avana unlock the secrets of the majik and overcome their own daemons, or are they fated to be witnesses to the death of their world and all whom they love?" />
