  <title>The Lost Prince - Frances Hodgson Burnett, Maurice L. Bower (Illustrator)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lost Prince by Frances Hodgson Burnett.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is about Marco Loristan, his father, and his friend, a street urchin called &amp;quot;The Rat&amp;quot;. Marco&amp;#39;s father, Stefan, is a Samavian patriot working to overthrow the cruel dictatorship in the kingdom of Samavia. Marco and his father come to London where Marco strikes up a friendship with a crippled street urchin known as The Rat. The friendship occurs when Marco overhears The Rat shouting in military form. Marco discovers he had stumbled upon a club known as the Squad, where the boys drill under the leadership of The Rat, whose education and imagination far exceeds their own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stefan, realizing that two boys are less likely to be noticed, entrusts them with a secret mission to travel across Europe giving the secret sign: &amp;#39;The Lamp is lighted.&amp;#39; Marco is to go as the Bearer of the Sign while The Rat goes as his Aide-de-Camp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This brings about a revolution which succeeds in overthrowing the old regime and re-establishing the rightful king. When Marco and The Rat return to London, Stefan has already left for Samavia. They wait there with his father&amp;#39;s faithful bodyguard, Lazarus, until Stefan calls. The book ends in a climactic scene as Marco realizes his father is the descendant of Ivor Fedorovitch and thus the rightful king of Samavia." />
