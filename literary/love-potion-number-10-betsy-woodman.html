  <title>Love Potion Number 10 - Betsy Woodman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the newest Jana Bibi adventure from Betsy Woodman, Jana, Mr. Ganguly, and the gang are back as their small town in India is rocked by an espionage scandal and a homemade remedy that has love on everyone&#39;s mind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jolly Grant House still welcomes all its visitors with the sign &lt;i&gt;Jana Bibi&#39;s Excellent Fortunes&lt;/i&gt; hanging proudly outside its front door. Jana&#39;s fortune-telling has brought a lot of attention to the small town of Hamara Nagar, and now that the dust has settled and the town is safe from the threat of being flooded by a government dam, all eyes are on the Scottish-born card-reader Jana and her feisty, loose-beaked parrot, Mr. Ganguly. Some people, though, are not to be trusted, and Mr. Ganguly finds himself the target of a potential kidnapping that puts Jana and her household on edge. &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, love is in the air and, thanks to Abenath&#39;s Apothecary, it&#39;s also in a bottle. Abenath has created an intoxicating brew that he calls Love Potion Number 10, which seems to have Jana in a tizzy. While she explores her newest hobby, dream interpretation, her head is swimming with questions: Is a new love possible at age fifty-nine? If so, would she ever marry again? All around her she sees different kinds of love and connection--family, arranged marriages, chemical attractions, even intercontinental romance between people who have only met through letters--so when an old flame arrives and rekindles long-gone feelings, Jana begins to think that Love Potion Number 10 just might be the magic elixir its inventor thinks it is.&lt;/p&gt;" />
