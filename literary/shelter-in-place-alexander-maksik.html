  <title>Shelter in Place - Alexander Maksik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A story about the things we’re willing to die for, and to kill for. Set in the Pacific Northwest in the jittery, jacked-up early 90s, from one of America&#39;s most thrillingly defiant contemporary storytellers, Shelter in Place is a stylish literary novel about the hereditary nature of mental illness, the fleeting intensity of youth, the obligations of family, and the consequences of all-consuming love.
Joseph March, a twenty-one-year-old working class kid from Seattle, is on top of the world. He has just graduated college, his future beckons, unencumbered. Joe&#39;s life implodes when he starts to suffer the symptoms of severe bipolar disorder, and, shortly after, his mother kills a man she&#39;s never met with a hammer. Joe moves to White Pine, Oregon, where his mother is in jail and his father has set up house to be near her. He is joined by Tess Wolff, a fiercely independent woman with whom he has fallen passionately in love. The lives of Joe, Tess, and Joe&#39;s father fall into the slow rhythm of daily prison visits and beer and pizza at a local bar. Meanwhile, Anne-Marie March, Joe&#39;s mother, is gradually becoming a local heroine as many begin to see her crime as a furious, exasperated act of righteous rebellion. Tess, too, has fallen under her spell. Spurred on by Anne-Marie&#39;s example, Tess enlists Joe in a secret, violent plan that will forever change their lives." />
