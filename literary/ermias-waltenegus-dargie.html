  <title>Ermias - Waltenegus Dargie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ermias&amp;rsquo; early family life is somewhat unusual: conceived by accident while his mother was a student, he lives in Addis Ababa with his paternal grandmother for most of his early years, while his mother pursues her studies and his father his business interests. At the age of six his mother is offered a PhD position in Gottingen and Ermias and his parents move to Germany together. There they become close friends of the Holms: Martha, Frank and their daughters Rhoda and Bord&amp;eacute;lique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years later the family move back to Addis. When Ermias is twelve his mother&amp;rsquo;s father dies, and he and his parents travel to the funeral. His mother doesn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy being back in her village among her family, but Ermias has a wonderful time, and persuades his parents to let him stay for an extra week without them. However, the seamy underbelly of life in the village is soon revealed to him &amp;ndash; violence, alcoholism and bestiality &amp;ndash; and he is relieved to return home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years later Ermias and his mother move to New York so that he can attend high school, in the hope that he will win a scholarship to a prestigious American university. In New York Ermias meets Nellie, his first love, who initially accepts him, but challenged by personal and familial crisis, rejects him. This unfortunate experience unlocks a series of overwhelming existential questions and distracts Ermias from his primary goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From New York Ermias moves to Europe to pursue a higher education, but there he has to determine what distinguishes his primary desire from all other desires, including the desire to fall in love with a married woman.&lt;/p&gt;" />
