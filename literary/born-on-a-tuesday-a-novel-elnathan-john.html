  <title>Born on a Tuesday: A Novel - Elnathan John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From two-time Caine Prize finalist Elnathan John, a dynamic young voice from Nigeria, &lt;I&gt;Born on a Tuesday&lt;/I&gt; is a stirring, starkly rendered first novel about a young boy struggling to find his place in a society that is fracturing along religious and political lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In far northwestern Nigeria, Dantala lives among a gang of street boys who sleep under a kuka tree. During the election, the boys are paid by the Small Party to cause trouble. When their attempt to burn down the opposition&amp;#8217;s local headquarters ends in disaster, Dantala must run for his life, leaving his best friend behind. He makes his way to a mosque that provides him with food, shelter, and guidance. With his quick aptitude and modest nature, Dantala becomes a favored apprentice to the mosque&amp;#8217;s sheikh. Before long, he is faced with a terrible conflict of loyalties, as one of the sheikh&amp;#8217;s closest advisors begins to raise his own radical movement. When bloodshed erupts in the city around him, Dantala must decide what kind of Muslim&amp;mdash;and what kind of man&amp;mdash;he wants to be. Told in Dantala&amp;#8217;s na&amp;#239;ve, searching voice, this astonishing debut explores the ways in which young men are seduced by religious fundamentalism and violence.&lt;/div&gt;" />
