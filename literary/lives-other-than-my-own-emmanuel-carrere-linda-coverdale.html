  <title>Lives Other Than My Own - Emmanuel Carrere, Linda Coverdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed award-winning author Emmanuel Carrère, &lt;i&gt;Lives Other Than My Own: A Memoir&lt;/i&gt; is an act of generous imagination that unflinchingly records devastating loss and, equally vividly, the wealth of human solace that follows in its wake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selected by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; as one of the 50 Best Memoirs of the Past 50 Years&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sri Lanka, a tsunami sweeps a child out to sea, her grand-father helpless against the onrushing water. In France, a young woman succumbs to illness, leaving her husband and small children bereft. Present at both events, Emmanuel Carrère sets out to tell the story of two families--shattered and ultimately restored.
