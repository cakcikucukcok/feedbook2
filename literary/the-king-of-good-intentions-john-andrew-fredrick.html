  <title>The King of Good Intentions - John Andrew Fredrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Set in Los Angeles in the early 90s, the novel chronicles the early days of an indie band as they meet, practice, make their first record, and get their first break/big gig. It&amp;#8217;s also the story of the the flowering love affair between John and Jenny, the two charming if troubled guitarists/singers in the band. John is by day a misanthropic substitute teacher in the zany, sometimes horrific LA Unified School District; Jenny is an mysterious recovering child prodigy. Along the way, the couple and their bandmates make momentous discoveries about themselves and the Hollywood milieu in which they struggle to succeed, a world peopled by narcissistic actors, wannabe screenwriters, pretentious musicians, weirdo fans, crazy neighbors -- and an emu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The King of Good Intentions&lt;/I&gt; was originally to have been published by Henry Rollins&amp;#8217;s 2.13.61 press in 1999. When Rollins decided henceforth to publish only his own work, Fredrick set the novel aside to focus on his musical and teaching career. Now it will finally make its long overdue debut.&lt;/div&gt;" />
