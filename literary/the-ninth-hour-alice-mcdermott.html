  <title>The Ninth Hour - Alice Mcdermott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A magnificent new novel from one of America&#39;s finest writers&lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;a powerfully affecting story spanning the twentieth century of a widow and her daughter and the nuns who serve their Irish-American community in Brooklyn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a dim winter afternoon, a young Irish immigrant opens a gas tap in his Brooklyn tenement. He is determined to prove--to the subway bosses who have recently fired him, to his pregnant wife--that &quot;the hours of his life . . . belonged to himself alone.&quot; In the aftermath of the fire that follows, Sister St. Saviour, an aging nun, a Little Nursing Sister of the Sick Poor, appears, unbidden, to direct the way forward for his widow and his unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Catholic Brooklyn in the early part of the twentieth century, decorum, superstition, and shame collude to erase the man&#39;s brief existence, and yet his suicide, though never spoken of, reverberates through many lives--testing the limits and the demands of love and sacrifice, of forgiveness and forgetfulness, even through multiple generations. Rendered with remarkable delicacy, heart, and intelligence, Alice McDermott&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Ninth Hour&lt;/i&gt; is a crowning achievement of one of the finest American writers at work today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
