  <title>The Water Beetles - Michael Kaan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner, 2018 Amazon Canada First Novel Award, 2018 McNally Robinson Book of the Year, and 2018 Margaret Laurence Award for Fiction&lt;br&gt;Shortlisted, 2017 Governor General&#39;s Award for Fiction and 2018 Eileen McTavish Sykes Award for Best First Book&lt;br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;National Post&lt;/i&gt; Best Book of 2017&lt;br&gt;A Walter Scott Prize Academy Recommended Historical Novel of 2017&lt;br&gt;On &lt;i&gt;CBC Books&#39;&lt;/i&gt; list of writers to watch in 2018&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leung family leads a life of secluded luxury in Hong Kong. But in December 1941, the Empire of Japan invades the colony. The family is quickly dragged into a spiral of violence, repression, and starvation. To survive, they entomb themselves and their friends in the Leung mansion. But this is only a temporary reprieve, and the Leungs are forced to send their children away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The youngest boy, Chung-Man, escapes with some of his siblings, and together they travel deep into the countryside to avoid the Japanese invaders. Thrown into a new world, Chung-Man befriends a young couple who yearn to break free of their rural life. But their friendship ends when the Japanese arrive, and Chung-Man is once again taken captive. Unwittingly and willingly, he enters a new cycle of violence and punishment, until he finally breaks free from his captors and returns to Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deeply scarred, Chung-Man drifts along respectfully and dutifully, enveloped by the unspoken vestiges of war. It is only as he leaves home once again &amp;#8212; this time for university in America &amp;#8212; that he finally glimpses a way to keep living with his troubled and divided self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written in restrained, yet beautiful and affecting prose, &lt;i&gt;The Water Beetles&lt;/i&gt; is an engrossing story of adventure and survival. Based loosely on the diaries and stories of the author&amp;#39;s father, this mesmerizing story captures the horror of war, through the eyes of a child, with unsettling and unerring grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
