  <title>The Exact Nature of Our Wrongs - Janet Peery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Library of Virginia&#39;s Emyl Jenkins Sexton Literary Award for Fiction!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A brilliantly moving and unforgettable novel.&quot; - Jill McCorkle, author of&lt;i&gt; Life After Life&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet Peery&#39;s first novel, &lt;i&gt;The River Beyond the World,&lt;/i&gt; was a National Book Award finalist in 1996. Acclaimed for her gorgeous writing and clear-eyed gaze into the hearts of people, Peery now returns with her second novel, &lt;i&gt;The Exact Nature of Our Wrongs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a summer evening in the blue-collar town of Amicus, Kansas, the Campbell family gathers for a birthday dinner for their ailing patriarch, retired judge Abel Campbell, prepared and hosted by their still-hale mother Hattie. But when Billy, the youngest sibling--with a history of addiction, grand ideas, and misdemeanors--passes out in his devil&#39;s food cake, the family takes up the unfinished business of Billy&#39;s sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billy&#39;s wayward adventures have too long consumed their lives, in particular Hattie&#39;s, who has enabled his transgressions while trying to save him from Abel&#39;s disappointment. As the older children--Doro, Jesse, ClairBell, and Gideon--contend with their own troubles, they compete for the approval of the elderly parents they adore, but can&#39;t quite forgive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With knowing humor and sure-handed storytelling, Janet Peery reveals a family at its best and worst, with old wounds and new, its fractures and feuds, and yet its unbreakable bonds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
