  <title>Frying Plantain - Zalika Reid-Benta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set in a neighbourhood known as &amp;#8220;Little Jamaica,&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;Frying Plantain&lt;/em&gt; follows one young girl from elementary school to high school graduation as she navigates the tensions between mothers and daughters, second-generation immigrants and first-generation cultural expectations, and Black identity and predominantly white society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kara Davis is a girl caught in the middle &amp;#8212; of her North American identity and her desire to be a &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; Jamaican, of her mother and grandmother&amp;#8217;s rages and life lessons, of having to avoid being thought of as too &amp;#8220;faas&amp;#8221; or too &amp;#8220;quiet&amp;#8221; or too &amp;#8220;bold&amp;#8221; or too &amp;#8220;soft.&amp;#8221; Set in a neighbourhood known as &amp;#8220;Little Jamaica,&amp;#8221; Kara moves from girlhood to the threshold of adulthood, from elementary school to high school graduation, in these twelve interconnected stories. We see her on a visit to Jamaica, startled by the sight of a severed pig&amp;#8217;s head in her great-aunt&amp;#8217;s freezer; in junior high, the victim of a devastating prank by her closest friends; and as a teenager in and out of her grandmother&amp;#8217;s house, trying to cope with the ongoing battles between her unyielding grandparents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rich and unforgettable portrait of growing up between worlds, &lt;em&gt;Frying Plantain&lt;/em&gt; shows how, in one charged moment, friendship and love can turn to enmity and hate, well-meaning protection can become control, and teasing play can turn to something much darker.&lt;/p&gt;" />
