  <title>Do You Think This Is Strange? - Aaron Cully Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted for the 2016 Amazon.ca First Novel Award&lt;br/&gt;Longlisted for the 2016 Leacock Medal for Humour Writing&lt;br/&gt;Winner of an Independent Publishers Book Award (IPPY)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddy is having a rough year. First, he is expelled from school for fighting. Now, at his new school, he is required to have regular conversations with a counselor—an awkward situation for anyone, really, but even more so for Freddy, who has autism. Not only that, Freddy’s mom left years ago and his dad drinks too much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Saskia—a fair-haired girl Freddy hasn’t seen in ten years—appears at his new school. As children they attended the same group therapy sessions, and now she is hardly the same person he remembers. She doesn’t smile. And she doesn’t talk. But their reunion provides him with respite in a difficult time, and sets a chain of meetings and events into motion that reveals long-repressed memories and brings Freddy to a unexpectedly freeing moment of truth. A funny and touching coming-of-age story you won’t forget.&lt;/p&gt;" />
