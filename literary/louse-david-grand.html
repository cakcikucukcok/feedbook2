  <title>Louse - David Grand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt; Best Book of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Herbert Horatio &quot;Poppy&quot; Blackwell was once a daring aviator, an illustrious movie producer, and a brilliant businessman. A Howard Hughes-like mogul, Poppy has become a recluse with paralyzing fears of infection. Cloistered in the penthouse high above his desert gambling empire, he is attended by a small army of maids and footmen and lawyers and physicians, who live in a state of constant surveillance as they cater to his eccentric, paranoid demands.&lt;br&gt;      Herman Q. Louse is Poppy&#39;s valet, one of the many indentured servants who have racked up an insurmountable debt in his casino (and whose long-term memories have subsequently been erased). Louse&#39;s primary duty is to administer Poppy&#39;s medication: near-lethal doses of benzodiazepines. But as he goes about his carefully monitored business, he becomes aware of a growing conspiracy against Poppy and becomes his unlikely protector--that is, until people start to point fingers at Louse.&lt;br&gt;      Dark, disturbing, yet acerbically funny, &lt;i&gt;Louse&lt;/i&gt; by David Grand is a vividly imagined tale, at once timely and unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
