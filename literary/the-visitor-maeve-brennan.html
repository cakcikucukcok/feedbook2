  <title>The Visitor - Maeve Brennan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The current revival of the work of Maeve Brennan, who died in obscurity in 1993, has won her a reputation as a twentieth-century classic&amp;#151;one of the best Irish writers of stories since Joyce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, unexpectedly, Brennan&#39;s oeuvre is immeasurably deepened and broadened by a miraculous literary discovery&amp;#151;a short novel written in the mid-1940s, but till now unknown and unpublished. Recently found in a university archive, it is a story of Dublin and of the unkind, ungenerous, emotionally unreachable side of the Irish temper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Visitor&lt;/I&gt; is the haunting tale of Anastasia King, who, at the age of twenty-two, returns to her grandmother&#39;s house&amp;#151;the very house where she grew up&amp;#151;after six long years away. She has been in Paris, comforting her disgraced and dying mother, the runaway from a disastrous marriage to Anastasia&#39;s late father, the grandmother&#39;s only son. &quot;It&#39;s a pity she sent for you.&quot; the grandmother says, smiling with anger. &quot;And a pity you went after her. It broke your father&#39;s heart.&quot;Anastasia pays dearly for the choice she made, a choice that now costs her her own strong sense of family and makes her an exile&amp;#151;a visitor&amp;#151;in the place she once called home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Penelope Fitzgerald, writing of Brennan&#39;s story &quot;The Springs of Affection,&quot; said that it carries an &quot;electric charge of resentment and quiet satisfaction in revenge that chills you right through.&quot; The same can be said of the &lt;I&gt;The Visitor&lt;/I&gt;, Maeve Brennan&#39;s &quot;lost&quot; novel&amp;#151;the early work of an incomparable master.&lt;/div&gt;" />
