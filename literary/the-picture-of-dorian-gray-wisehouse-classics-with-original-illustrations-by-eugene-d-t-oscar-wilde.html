  <title>The Picture of Dorian Gray (Wisehouse Classics - with original illustrations by Eugene Dété) - Oscar Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY&lt;/em&gt; is a philosophical novel by the writer Oscar Wilde, first published complete in the July 1890 issue of Lippincott&#39;s Monthly Magazine. The magazine&#39;s editor feared the story was indecent, and without Wilde&#39;s knowledge, deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year." />
