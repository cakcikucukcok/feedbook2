  <title>The Creed of Violence - Boston Teran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Mexico, 1910. The landscape pulses with the force of the upcoming revolution, an atmosphere rich in opportunity for a criminal such as Rawbone. His fortune arrives across the haze of the Sierra Blanca in the form of a truck loaded with weapons, an easy sell to those financing a bloodletting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But Rawbone&amp;#8217;s plan spins against him, and he soon finds himself at the Mexican-American border and in the hands of the Bureau of Investigation. He is offered a chance for immunity, but only if he agrees to proceed with his scheme to deliver the truck and its goods to the Mexican oil fields while under the command of Agent John Lourdes. Rawbone sees no other option and agrees to the deal&amp;#151;but he fails to recognize the true identity of Agent Lourdes, a man from deep within his past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As they work to expose the criminal network at the core of the revolution, it is clear their journey into the tarred desert is a push toward a certain ruin, and the history lurking between the criminal and agent may seal their fates.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
