  <title>Ordinary Decent Criminals - Lionel Shriver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A new edition of one of bestselling author Lionel Shriver&amp;#8217;s early novels, reissued 25 years after first publication&amp;#8212;an engrossing commentary on the intersection of politics and human relationships, set in turbulent Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ten years, Estrin Lancaster has fled Philadelphia. From the Philippines to Berlin, she&amp;#8217;s been a traveler without a destination, an expatriate without a motherland. In each of the cities Estrin favors, she manages an apartment, a job, a lover, and never tarries past the first signs of ennui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her latest destination is Belfast, in Northern Ireland. After twenty years of ritualized violence, this city, too, is exhausted&amp;#8212;a town where when one more bomb explodes in the city center, old ladies blow the dust off their treacle cakes and count their change. Here the lanky and spiteful Farrell O&amp;#8217;Phelan, former purveyor of his own bomb-disposal service, technically Catholic but everyone&amp;#8217;s aggravation, wrangles through the maze of factions in the North by despising every side. Farrell&amp;#8217;s affair with the curious Estrin is nonetheless a meeting of two loners; like hers, Farrell&amp;#8217;s marathoning around the planet has become a running in place. In deadlocked Northern Ireland, it has become harder and harder to believe that anything is happening at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A grand tragi-comedy&amp;#8212;one of the earliest displays of the ambition and intelligence that has since earned Lionel Shriver worldwide acclaim&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Ordinary Decent Criminals&lt;/em&gt; is about conflict groupies, people terrified of domesticity, who stir up anguish in their lives and their countries to avoid the greater horror of what lies closest to home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
