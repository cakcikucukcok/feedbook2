  <title>Yes, My Darling Daughter - Margaret Leroy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Every once in a blue moon, a masterful writer dives into gothic waters and emerges with a novel that&lt;/i&gt;--&lt;i&gt;like Daphne du Maurier&#39;s &lt;/i&gt;Rebecca&lt;i&gt;, Minette Walters&#39;s &lt;/i&gt;The Breaker&lt;i&gt;, and Donna Tartt&#39;s &lt;/i&gt;The Little Friend--&lt;i&gt;simultaneously celebrates and transcends the tradition. Welcome Margaret Leroy to the clan.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the matter with Sylvie?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a pretty girl. Four years old; well loved by her young mother, Grace. But there&#39;s something . . . &quot;off &quot; about the child. Her deathly fear of water; her night terrors; most of all, her fixation with a photo of an Irish seaside town called Coldharbour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Sylvie, tell me about your picture. Why&#39;s it so special, sweetheart?&quot; My heart is racing, but I try to make my voice quite calm.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;That&#39;s my seaside, Grace.&quot; Very matter-of-fact, as though this should be obvious. &quot;I lived there, Grace. Before.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace doesn&#39;t know what to do with this revelation--she&#39;s barely scraping by as it is. A single mother with no family, Grace works full-time at a London flower shop to support herself and Sylvie. Overwhelmed by her inability to help her daughter, she turns to Adam Winters, a dashing psychology professor with some unusual theories about what might be troubling the child. Together, they travel to seemingly idyllic Coldharbour, hoping to understand Sylvie&#39;s mysterious connection to the place. Impossible as it may seem, Grace has to accept that her daughter may be remembering a past life. And not only that: the danger bedeviling Sylvie from her past life is still very much a threat to her in this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Leroy has been celebrated for writing &quot;like a dream,&quot; and her previous novels have been praised for their &quot;hypnotic prose&quot; and &quot;sensuously ethereal, subtly electric drama.&quot; Now, in &lt;i&gt;Yes,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;My Darling Daughter&lt;/i&gt;, Leroy offers a novel both haunted and haunting--a wonderfully original, deliciously suspenseful story that enthralls from the first page to the very last.&lt;/p&gt;" />
