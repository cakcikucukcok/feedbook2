  <title>The Cut - Anthony Cartwright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Cut is a Brexit novel. The story offers a fictional response to a complex issue. It is also a plot-driven page-turner by one of the most exciting novelists in the country.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cairo Jukes, a boxer from Dudley, supports himself on zero-hour contracts. He has grown up among the canals &amp;amp;#8211; or the cuts &amp;amp;#8211; that web the Black Country like the open veins of an old industrial order. Then he meets Grace, a successful documentary film maker from London.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cut will not put you at ease. It describes a relationship built on misunderstandings, intolerance and guilt &amp;amp;#8211; one where each side desires something that the other cannot give.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;amp;#8216;Writing The Cut made me understand that we live in a country where we see prejudice in others but not in ourselves. This is a lesson that I, and my two characters Cairo and Grace, have tried to learn, with varying levels of success. It is a hard lesson for us all.&amp;amp;#8217; Anthony Cartwright:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Peirene chose to commission this book:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;The result of the EU referendum shocked me. I realized that I had been living in one part of a divided country. What fears &amp;amp;#8211; and what hopes &amp;amp;#8211; drove my fellow citizens to vote for Brexit? I commissioned Anthony Cartwright to build a fictional bridge between the Britains that opposed each other on referendum day.&amp;amp;#8217; &lt;b&gt;Meike Ziervogel, publisher at Peirene Press&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for Anthony Cartwright:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;amp;#8216;A writer with a wonderful ear &amp;amp;#8230; and an unblinking sense of Britain as it is today. Anthony Cartwright&amp;amp;#8217;s patient, attentive storytelling shines a glowing light on areas of our common experience that the English novel usually consigns to darkness.&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jonathan Coe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;amp;#8216;A compelling protest against simple answers that lingers in the mind long after the final page.&amp;amp;#8217;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wyl Menmuir&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;A bittersweet elegy to Britain&#39;s battered working classes.&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metro&lt;/b&gt;" />
