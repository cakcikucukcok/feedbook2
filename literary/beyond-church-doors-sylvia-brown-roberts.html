  <title>Beyond Church Doors - Sylvia Brown-Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Forty-year-old Nikolis McQuaigecalled NikkiMacis a teacher in Trenton, New Jersey, and is smart, quick, and loyal to her friends. Shes also single and struggles to be a good Christian. She thinks of herself as a work in progress, and God has been helping her make improvements in various areas of her lifesuch as in her choice of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But men arent the only thing on NikkiMacs mind. Theres her best friend, Jacee, and a new friend, Anna Maria. Theres her friend Cletus, whos trying hard to stay on the wagon and do right by the twins he finds out are his biological children. And then theres Sister Chloe, a new member of the church, who is coolalmost downright rudeto NikkiMac for reasons NikkiMac cant fathom. She even finds time to think of the new, eligible assistant preacher named Adam Greene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By turns humorous and poignant, &lt;i&gt;Beyond Church Doors&lt;/i&gt; invites us into NikkiMacs world of urban grittiness and sass, where being a Christian means asking forgiveness when her anger at another woman leads to near tragedy. It means not giving up on asking friends to church. It means being willing to don a bright orange lifeguard outfit and whistle to stand by the baptistery so that a churchgoer, terrified of drowning, can let herself be baptized. NikkiMac doesnt practice Sunday-morning-only Christianity, but lives her faith in the community 24-7 with a refreshing candor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Sylvia Brown-Roberts  reunites us with her vivid characters as they seek to translate their faith into Godly behavior.  An inspirational novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael A. Brown, author of &lt;i&gt;In Search of the Narrow Way&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
