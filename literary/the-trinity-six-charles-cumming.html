  <title>The Trinity Six - Charles Cumming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; Notable Fiction Book for 2011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most closely-guarded secret of the Cold War is about to be exposed - the identity of a SIXTH member of the infamous Cambridge spy ring. And people are killing for it... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London, 1992. Late one night, Edward Crane, 76, is declared dead at a London hospital. An obituary describes him only as a &#39;resourceful career diplomat&#39;. But Crane was much more than that - and the circumstances surrounding his death are far from what they seem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years later, academic Sam Gaddis needs money. When a journalist friend asks for his help researching a possible sixth member of the notorious Trinity spy ring, Gaddis knows that she&#39;s onto a story that could turn his fortunes around. But within hours the journalist is dead, apparently from a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking over her investigation, Gaddis trails a man who claims to know the truth about Edward Crane. Europe still echoes with decades of deadly disinformation on both sides of the Iron Curtain. And as Gaddis follows a series of leads across the continent, he approaches a shocking revelation - one which will rock the foundations of politics from London to Moscow...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cumming&#39;s novel is characterized by a gripping sense of realism. He displays a vast knowledge of spycraft and Cold War history, and the dense, three-dimensional world he crafts comes complete with seedy hotels and smoky nightclubs. The result is absolutely gripping. Taut, atmospheric and immersive--an instant classic.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt; (starred review) on &lt;i&gt;The Trinity Six&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Trinity Six&lt;/i&gt; is a Kirkus Reviews Best of 2011 Thrillers title.&lt;/p&gt;" />
