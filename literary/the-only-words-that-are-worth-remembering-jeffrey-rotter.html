  <title>The Only Words That Are Worth Remembering - Jeffrey Rotter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A darkly comic, wildly original novel of a family in flight from the law, set in a near-future American dystopia.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an America of the semi-distant future, human knowledge has reverted to a pre-Copernican state. Science and religion are diminished to fairy tales, and Earth once again occupies the lonely center of the universe, the stars and planets mere etchings on the glass globe that encases it. But when an ancient bunker containing a perfectly preserved space vehicle is discovered beneath the ruins of Cape Canaveral, it has the power to turn this retrograde world inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the miscreant Van Zandt clan, whose run-ins with the law leave them with a no-win choice: test-pilot the spacecraft together as a family, or be sent separately to prison for life. Their decision leads to some freakish slapstick, one nasty bonfire, and a dissolute trek across the ass-end of an all-too-familiar America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As told to his daughter by Rowan, the Van Zandt son who flees the ashes of his family in search of a new one, the story is a darkly comic road trip that pits the simple hell of solitude against the messy consolations of togetherness.&lt;br&gt;Jeffrey Rotter&#39;s&lt;i&gt; The Only Words That Are Worth Remembering&lt;/i&gt; is an indelible vision of a future in which we might one day live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
