  <title>The Cook - Maylis de Kerangal, Sam Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A slim, bountiful, beautifully written (and gorgeously translated) &#39;Portrait of the Chef as a Young Man.&#39;&quot; --Nancy Klinke, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of BBC Culture&#39;s Ten Books to Read this March and &lt;i&gt;The Rumpus&lt;/i&gt; Book Club Pick for March&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maylis de Kerangal follows up her acclaimed novel &lt;i&gt;The Heart &lt;/i&gt;with a dissection of the world of a young Parisian chef&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More like a poetic biographical essay on a fictional person than a novel, &lt;i&gt;The Cook &lt;/i&gt;is a coming-of-age journey centered on Mauro, a young self-taught cook. The story is told by an unnamed female narrator, Mauro&#39;s friend and disciple who we also suspect might be in love with him. Set not only in Paris but in Berlin, Thailand, Burma, and other far-flung places over the course of fifteen years, the book is hyperrealistic--to the point of feeling, at times, like a documentary. It transcends this simplistic form, however, through the lyricism and intensely vivid evocative nature of Maylis de Kerangal&#39;s prose, which conjures moods, sensations, and flavors, as well as the exhausting rigor and sometimes violent abuses of kitchen work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Cook&lt;/i&gt;, we follow Mauro as he finds his path in life: baking cakes as a child; cooking for his friends as a teenager; a series of studies, jobs, and travels; a failed love affair; a successful business; a virtual nervous breakdown; and--at the end--a rediscovery of his hunger for cooking, his appetite for life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
