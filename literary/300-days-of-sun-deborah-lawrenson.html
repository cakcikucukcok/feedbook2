      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Combining the atmosphere of Jess Walters&amp;#8217; &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Ruins&lt;/em&gt; with the intriguing historical backstory of Christina Baker Kline&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Orphan Train, &lt;/em&gt;Deborah Lawrenson&amp;#8217;s mesmerizing novel transports readers to a sunny Portuguese town with a shadowy past&amp;#8212;where two women, decades apart, are drawn into a dark game of truth and lies that still haunts the shifting sea marshes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traveling to Faro, Portugal, journalist Joanna Millard hopes to escape an unsatisfying relationship and a stalled career. Faro is an enchanting town, and the seaside views are enhanced by the company of Nathan Emberlin, a charismatic younger man. But behind the crumbling facades of Moorish buildings, Joanna soon realizes, Faro has a seedy underbelly, its economy compromised by corruption and wartime spoils. And Nathan has an ulterior motive for seeking her company: he is determined to discover the truth involving a child&amp;#8217;s kidnapping that may have taken place on this dramatic coastline over two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joanna&amp;#8217;s subsequent search leads her to Ian Rylands, an English expat who cryptically insists she will find answers in &lt;em&gt;The Alliance&lt;/em&gt;, a novel written by American Esta Hartford. The book recounts an American couple&amp;#8217;s experience in Portugal during World War II, and their entanglements both personal and professional with their German enemies. Only Rylands insists the book isn&amp;#8217;t fiction, and as Joanna reads deeper into &lt;em&gt;The Alliance&lt;/em&gt;, she begins to suspect that Esta Hartford&amp;#8217;s story and Nathan Emberlin&amp;#8217;s may indeed converge in Faro&amp;#8212;where the past not only casts a long shadow but still exerts a very present danger.&lt;/p&gt;" />
