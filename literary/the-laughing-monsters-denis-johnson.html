  <title>The Laughing Monsters - Denis Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Denis Johnson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Laughing Monsters, &lt;/i&gt;is a high-suspense tale of kaleidoscoping loyalties in the post-9/11 world that shows one of our great novelists at the top of his game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roland Nair calls himself Scandinavian but travels on a U.S. passport. After ten years&#39; absence, he returns to Freetown, Sierra Leone, to reunite with his friend Michael Adriko. They once made a lot of money here during the country&#39;s civil war, and, curious to see whether good luck will strike twice in the same place, Nair has allowed himself to be drawn back to a region he considers hopeless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adriko is an African who styles himself a soldier of fortune and who claims to have served, at various times, the Ghanaian army, the Kuwaiti Emiri Guard, and the American Green Berets. He&#39;s probably broke now, but he remains, at thirty-six, as stirred by his own doubtful schemes as he was a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Nair believes some kind of money-making plan lies at the back of it all, Adriko&#39;s stated reason for inviting his friend to Freetown is for Nair to meet Adriko&#39;s fiancée, a grad student from Colorado named Davidia. Together the three set out to visit Adriko&#39;s clan in the Uganda-Congo borderland--but each of these travelers is keeping secrets from the others. Their journey through a land abandoned by the future leads Nair, Adriko, and Davidia to meet themselves not in a new light, but rather in a new darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
