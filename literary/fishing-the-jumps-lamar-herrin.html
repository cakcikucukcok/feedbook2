  <title>Fishing the Jumps - Lamar Herrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;&quot;But in fishing the jumps there comes a moment when an insatiable hunger rises up in you and everything turns wild.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;The term &quot;fishing the jumps&quot; speaks to a method of catching fish while they&#39;re in the midst of a wild, frenzied state. And just like the undercurrents that exist in the lakes on which this tale is based, some relationships have a way of hiding -- and revealing -- turmoil just beneath the surface. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In his latest novel, award-winning writer Lamar Herrin highlights the art of storytelling and the value of friendship with a lush, outdoor landscape serving as a backdrop. Set over the course of a weekend spent fishing on an Adirondack lake, two middle-aged friends -- Jim McManus and Walter Kidman -- sip Jim Beam on the rocks and share tales of memory and camaraderie as the past and present meld to reveal that what happens in the past rarely stays there.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Lyrical and poetic, playful and entertaining,  &lt;I&gt;Fishing the Jumps&lt;/I&gt; is more than just fishing tales. It is a seamless and haunting novel that is ultimately a story of the deep and necessary relationship between two men and the binding and nourishing effect of family -- not only of an extended family, but of a whole community, and in fact, a whole region.&lt;/P&gt;" />
