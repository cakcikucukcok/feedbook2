  <title>The Call of Destiny - Marcus Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While reading this book, you will come across the word individual an awful lot. The clear objective of this book is to inspire people to look at themselves as individuals as it pertains to making the world a stronger, and prosperous place for future generations. I emphasize the importance of individual responsibility, hard work, self-determination, and personal integrity. In this book, I thoroughly advocate the significance in young adults to receive a world-class education. I emphasize the need for individuals to exemplify the Judeo-Christian principles upon which the United States was founded; free enterprise, individual liberty, and personal responsibility. As we continue to wake up every morning in a broken society, we should not continue to ignore the perils of it. In this book, you will learn the tools in making our society better, you will learn of the importance in receiving an education, and you will obtain a set of core values and principles in which to live by. Also, I would like for you to take what you have learned from this book and pass it onto the others, pressing the significance in advancing a prosperous world." />
