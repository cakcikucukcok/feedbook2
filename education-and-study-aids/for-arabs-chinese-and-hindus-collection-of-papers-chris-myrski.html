  <title>For Arabs, Chinese, and Hindus (Collection of Papers) - Chris Myrski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This folder is creative revision of the materials put in the CIS-folder (“??? ???? ???-???”) yet this is not translation but adaptation to the new auditory. On the other hand this is not a book but a small series of, at present 3, related papers, intended to give you initial ideas about the best world language, which is ... Bulgarian, up to my word! The questions are very important for all people. I have put it poetically in the following couplet. | 
Dear reader, this collection is for you, | 
Be you Arab, Chinese, or — why not? — Hind`oo, | 
It’s about language for the world as whole, | 
Which is easy, nice, best choice, and water holds. | 
And here are the names of the materials. |
Bulgarian Lessons [this is a simple yet utterly untraditional /introduction/ to this language] | 
Under Bulgarian banner [where is meant the language observed as /world language/] | 
Down With The English (Language)! | [what is said, and is explained why I think so] |" />
