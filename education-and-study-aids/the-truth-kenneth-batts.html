  <title>The Truth - Kenneth Batts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;This is a book of insight. It shines light on areas that a person might not see and most definitely understand. The information inside has the potential to cause a life changing experience. It touches on many areas of topic which can cause self-examination. With self-examination, that alone causes evolution and the basic structure of evolution is growing, being better than yourself in the past. The interesting content inside of each topic pulls you into areas of understanding, areas of obvious suspicion that some might not be able to see, areas of understanding existence, and how to fix a corrupt situation just to name a few. The biggest thing about all this information is that it just might be the blue print, the road map, and the compass to a better world. We all need guidance but who will give it? The time is now to be lead into the land of milk and honey. The question will remain, do you want to go and will you do what it takes to get there which is travel. A better world can happen in 7 years but it can start tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
