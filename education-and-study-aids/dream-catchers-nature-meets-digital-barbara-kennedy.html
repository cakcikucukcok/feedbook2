  <title>DREAM CATCHERS  -  Nature Meets Digital - Barbara Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Look inside a thing to know its wonder. Just like snowflakes, no two dream catchers&amp;ndash;or dreams&amp;ndash;are alike. Stick out your tongue and catch one on the very tip of it. Lick it. Roll it around on your tongue. Awaken your palate. Then take a bigger bite. Worst case, you&amp;#39;ll spit it out. Most likely, you&amp;#39;ll be back. It may take a while. We tend to fight it; it hurts so good. Dreams are sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet. But like a rare single malt Scotch in a crystal tumbler, you acquire a taste for it. You will want more. You will be back. Guaranteed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything you need has already been given to you. All you need to add is a dream and shake. Look up. Reach out. Catch a dream, ride a wave. Worst case, you fall out of bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is best when downloaded onto a tablet or device where you can play with the photographs and expand them in order to travel through them and view the precision inner workings of nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Ancient legend originates with the Grandmother Spider, who sang the universe into existence but was saddened by the dreams of children.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photography is a marriage of light, subject, and time. An image is frozen in time, in a particular light, at a fractional moment, through a particular lens, and viewed by you. Thus, you become part of the ecology of the image. As you own the emotion evoked by the image, the original energy that snapped the camera in the first place, is re-energized and lives on in the energy you give to it, as the image continues to sensate.      &amp;ndash;The Ecology of Photography&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
