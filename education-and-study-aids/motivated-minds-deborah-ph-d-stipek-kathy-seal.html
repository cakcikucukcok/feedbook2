  <title>Motivated Minds - Deborah Ph.D. Stipek, Kathy Seal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Motivated Minds--&lt;/i&gt;a practical guide to ensuring your child&#39;s success in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes students succeed in school? For the past twenty years, the focus has been on building children&#39;s self-esteem to help them achieve more in the classroom. But positive reinforcement hasn&#39;t necessarily resulted in measureable academic improvement. Through extensive research, combined with ongoing classroom implementation of their ideas, Deborah Stipek, Dean of the School of Education at Stanford, and Kathy Seal have created a program that will encourage motivation and a love of learning in children from toddlerhood through elementary school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stipek and Seal maintain that parents and teachers can build a solid foundation for learning by helping children to develop the key elements of success: competency, autonomy, curiosity, and critical relationships. The authors offer both practical advice and strategies on understanding different learning styles for Math and reading as well as down-to-earth tips about how to manage difficult issues -- competition, grades, praise, bribes, and rewards -- that inevitably arise for parents and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most important, Stipek and Seal help parents create an enriching environment for their children at home that will mesh with the school experience and become a positive, effective climate for learning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
