  <title>The System Redesigned - This Time for Children - Norma Simpson Wilt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If Americas children are to become literate, compassionate, empathetic, happy and productive members of a society which they themselves must preserve and perpetuate, we must return to a time when learning was successful  when all children read. This will not happen in the present system where we allow some children to sit and be less than they are, while we try to force others to be more than they can be. In either case, we make them all less than they could become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have forgotten how vital the need is for the promotion of a healthy self-image in young children, and how vitally necessary it is to the learning process. Forgotten is their radar-like ability to sense rejection, dislike and disapproval. Young children are like soft clay, everything leaves an imprint - the drawn eyebrows, a frown, harsh words or sarcastic remarks. All are computer by our children. And processed. And stored. AND affect learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many realize we have a problem regarding the education of our children, no one seems to know why or what to do about it. Walk with me through that system and you will. This book takes you inside the actual classroom where you will see how we have focused too long on what adults want rather than on what children need. It is time to look at how a child learns. We have been looking at how to maintain a system.&lt;/p&gt;" />
