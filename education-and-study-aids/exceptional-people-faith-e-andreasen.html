For educators, it provides a window to the souls of the children whose lives they affect on a daily basis and offers proven strategies that can be implemented immediately. For students, it describes how they can successfully overcome the embarrassment of their special education label, the humiliation of being bullied by classmates, and the discomfort felt when called &amp;ldquo;stupid&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lazy&amp;rdquo; by their teachers. For parents, it captures their pain when they first learned their child had a disability and the fight they faced as they attempted to advocate for their child (usually not knowing their legal rights, the correct questions to ask, or the organizations available to support them). An easy read with a powerful message, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Exceptional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;People&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; conveys significant insights through its personal stories and professional tips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
