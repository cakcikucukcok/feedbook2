  <title>Compendium - Dr. Anupama Rajesh, Prateek Mangal, Nirav Sahni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Management cases are an inseparable part of any Business School class. Cases help students understand complex business situations, apply theoretical knowledge and learn to articulate their opinions before any audience. 
The cases can be valuable to both students and instructors alike because one learns better when actively engaged. Tedious theoretical concepts are retained longer and understood better when they are applied to real life situations and discussed in classrooms extensively. These deliberations have an inherent benefit of honing their convincing and negotiation skills and developing communication capabilities. Case discussions and presentations also develop team building and inter-personal skills. 
This book contains narrations of various business scenarios which require critical thinking and strategic decision making. They begin with the central problem and go on as an interesting story, culminating at a point which requires responses from its readers. They may talk of a fundamental business issue but are narrated in a suspenseful, stylised and exciting context.
This book is aimed at management students, scholars and executives working in the corporate." />
