  <title>Quantum Leaps in School Leadership - Perry R. Rettig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book theorizes that models based on the classical sciences have misguided educational leadership. Dr. Rettig sees the open dynamics of twentieth-century science-specifically, quantum mechanics - as a better and more natural model, and describes what he sees as a method of leadership light years beyond those of today. Dr. Rettig illustrates his critique of the contemporary school administration structure with the story of Leslie O&#39;Connor, a fictional administrator, who makes her way through familiar-seeming training techniques. For anyone interested in the organization and administration of school systems, this book provides an original and compelling perspective." />
