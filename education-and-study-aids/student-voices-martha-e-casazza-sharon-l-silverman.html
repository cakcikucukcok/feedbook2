  <title>Student Voices - Martha E. Casazza, Sharon L. Silverman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are surrounded by voices, but how often do we actually stop and listen to the stories they have to tell? Martha E.Casazza and Sharon L. Silverman have been listening to the stories of students for the past five years, and they share how high achievers have overcome obstacles.
Throughout the interviews, students told the authors having someone believe in them was key to their success. Find out what else made a difference in their lives by listening closely to Student Voices.
This book offers a fundamental truth: If you listen carefully when students talk, you will learn a great deal. Casazza and Silverman listened, and the result is both a celebration of student achievement and a model for how to foster it.
Mike Rose, author, Back to School: Why Everyone Deserves a Second Chance at Education
Casazza and Silverman go right to the source, the purest source, the student voice, to find out what truly works for students.  This is what we as educators need to hear and heed if we truly want to succeed in our efforts to improve education.
