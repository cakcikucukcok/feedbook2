  <title>Girl Bullying - Sam Littlemore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We have to change the perception of girl bullying as ‘just girls being girls’ and a normal part of growing up; in Girl Bullying, Dr Sam offers practical suggestions to do just this. As a society we can work towards a truly embedded anti-bullying ethos, through policies, education, socialisation and involving everyone. We all know that bullying can have a detrimental effect on the academic attainment, self-esteem and day-to-day lives of all the individuals involved; the victims, bystanders and, of course, the bullies themselves. The voices of the young people who have informed Dr Sam’s research are testimony to this. Relational aggression, social exclusion, cyberbullying, these are just some of the issues which can affect girls’ peer relationships and severely impact on their own self-esteem. Healthier coping strategies are skills that help us all to function effectively not just in a school environment, but throughout life. Dr Sam’s aim is to help adults working with girls to develop a toolbox of pro-active, pro-social strategies and understanding. This book does not offer a one-size-fits-all solution of how to stop girl bullying; indeed, such a thing does not exist. Dealing with these issues takes the time and patience, trust and knowledge of those involved, and most of all it takes the willingness to appreciate the world around girls today. Increase your understanding of modern girl bullying, including the fallout and psychological impact for both victims and perpetrators and discover support strategies to help. The essential guide for school staff, parents or any adult working with girls of all ages." />
