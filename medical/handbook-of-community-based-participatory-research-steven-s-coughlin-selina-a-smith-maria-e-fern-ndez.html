  <title>Handbook of Community-Based Participatory Research - Steven S. Coughlin, Selina A. Smith, Maria E. Fern치ndez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Community-based participatory research (CBPR) emerged in response to the longstanding tradition of &quot;top-down&quot; research-studies in which social scientists observe social phenomena and community problems as outsiders, separate from the participants&#39; daily lives. CBPR is more immersive, fostering partnerships between academic and community organizations that increase the value and consequence of the research for all partners. The current perspectives gleaned from this school of research have been wildly well-received, in no small part because they address the complexity of the human experience in their conclusions.
HANDBOOK OF COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH codifies the methods and theories of this research approach and articulates an expansive vision of health that includes gender equality, safe and adequate housing, and freedom from violence. Topic-based chapters apply the theory and methods of CBPR to real world problems affecting women, ethnic and racial minorities, and immigrant communities such as sexual violence, exposure to environmental toxins, and lack of access to preventive care as well as suggesting future directions for effective, culturally sensitive research.
HANDBOOK OF COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH is required reading for academics, policy makers, and students seeking meaningful social change through scholarship." />
