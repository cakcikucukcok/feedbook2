  <title>Succeeding in your Medical School OSCEs - Bhoresh Dhamija</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The OSCE – Objective Structured Clinical Examination – is a method of examination that is now a commonly used assessment tool in undergraduate medicine to test candidate’s core skills, understanding and attitudes in a wide variety of settings, this includes: performing a physical examination, taking and presenting a history, performing clinical procedures, analysing and interpreting a set of clinical data and communicating with patients in difficult and often highly charged situations. This new book is a candidate’s comprehensive guide to everything they need to know about the OSCE process. With clear explanation and an excellent easy to read format, it provides a step by step approach to 150 scenarios, including the most commonly encountered stations during undergraduate OSCEs in UK medical schools today. This book provides the candidate with a set of skills to tackle variations in systems, and excellent advice and tips that will give a solid platform by teaching what to say, how to say it and other techniques to impress the examiner. All clinical details have been reviewed to ensure it is in line with current best practice guidelines to give the most up-to-date text available. Whilst the primary intention of this book is to give candidates a set of tools at their disposal to achieve success at Undergraduate OSCEs, the book will also be of use to foundation doctors and beyond who wish to hone their clinical skills and understanding of topics seen on hospital wards daily." />
