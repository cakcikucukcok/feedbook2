  <title>Soames&#39; &amp; Southam&#39;s Oral Pathology - Max Robinson, Keith Hunter, Michael Pemberton, Philip Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A sound understanding of clinical oral pathology is essential if a dental clinician is to navigate successfully through clinical guidelines, make timely referrals to specialists, and provide good care for patients. This new edition of Soames&#39; &amp; Southam&#39;s Oral Pathology provides a clear and friendly guide for students, practitioners, and the whole dental team.
Thoroughly updated for today&#39;s clinical practice, this textbook covers &#39;must-know&#39; oral pathology and integrates key aspects of oral medicine. It begins by explaining the principles of clinical assessment, the synthesis of a differential diagnosis, and the selection of further investigations including laboratory tests. Ten chapters bring this theory to life by looking at the clinical and pathological features of a wide range of common oral diseases including oral cancer, salivary gland
disorders, and diseases of the jaws. Two new chapters address skin diseases affecting the oro-facial region and neck lumps. A final chapter highlights the importance of clinical oral pathology in the context of systemic human disease.
New radiology content includes examples of cross-sectional imaging. Photomicrographs have been replaced with carefully selected images to illustrate key pathological features. Each chapter includes key points boxes and tables to aid learning.
Written by experts in both oral pathology and oral medicine, this new edition is a must-have for dentistry students, and those working in the field, providing current and trustworthy information." />
