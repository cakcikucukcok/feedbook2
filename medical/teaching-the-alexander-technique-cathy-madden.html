  <title>Teaching the Alexander Technique - Cathy Madden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thoughtful and accessible, this guidebook unpacks the teaching process of the Alexander Technique for new and more experienced practitioners. By demonstrating the pathway from learning the Alexander Technique for oneself to teaching it, Madden identifies the skill sets required for excellence in teaching the Alexander Technique, and shows readers how they can acquire and develop these skills themselves. Observation, communication and tactile skills are all covered, and particular attention is paid to group teaching, which is neglected in current literature. This is combined with discussion of current research on education and neuroscience, enabling the reader to build a truly informed and effective practice.
Featuring a variety of examples and stories, it will prove a valuable resource to any teacher of the Alexander Technique, both active and prospective, and to practitioners of other modalities exploring ways to deepen their practice." />
