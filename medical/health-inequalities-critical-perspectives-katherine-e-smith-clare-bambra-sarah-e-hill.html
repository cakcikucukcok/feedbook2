  <title>Health Inequalities: Critical Perspectives - Katherine E. Smith, Clare Bambra, Sarah E. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Informed by a wealth of available research, between 1997 and 2010, the UK Labour government introduced a raft of policies to reduce health inequalities. Despite this, by most measures, the UKs health inequalities have continued to widen. This failure has prompted calls for new approaches to health inequalities research and some consensus that public health researchers ought to be more actively involved in public health advocacy. Yet there is currently no agreementas to what these new research agendas should be and despite multiple commentaries reflecting on recent UK efforts to reduce health inequalities, there has so far been little attempt to map future directions for research or to examine what more egalitarian policies means in practical terms. &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;Health Inequalities: Critical Perspectives&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; addresses these concerns. It takes stock of the UKs experiences of health inequalities research and policy to date, reflecting on the lessons that have been learnt from these experiences, both within the UK and internationally. The book identifies emergent research and policy topics, exploring the perspectives of actors working in a range of professional settings on these agendas. Finally, the book considerspotential ways of improving the links between health inequalities research, policy and practice, including via advocacy.With contributions from established, international health inequalities experts and newer, up-and-coming researchers in the field, as well as individuals working on health inequalities in policy, practice and civil society settings, &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;Health Inequalities: Critical Perspectives&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; is a must buy for researchers, postgraduate students, policymakers, practitioners, and research funders." />
