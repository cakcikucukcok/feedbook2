  <title>Political Sociology and the People&#39;s Health - Jason Beckfield, Nancy Krieger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A social epidemiologist looks at health inequalities in terms of the upstream factors that produced them. A political sociologist sees these same inequalities as products of institutions that unequally allocate power and social goods. Neither is wrong -- but can the two talk to one another?
In a stirring new synthesis, &lt;em&gt;Political Sociology and the People&#39;s Health&lt;/em&gt; advances the debate over social inequalities in health by offering a new set of provocative hypotheses around how health is distributed in and across populations. It joins political sociology&#39;s macroscopic insights into social policy, labor markets, and the racialized and gendered state with social epidemiology&#39;s conceptualizations and measurements of populations, etiologic periods, and distributions.
The result is a major leap forward in how we understand the relationships between institutions and inequalities -- and essential reading for those in public health, sociology, and beyond." />
