  <title>Licensed to Kill - Barbara Every</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Barb Every  Wife, Mother, Grand Mother and Great Grand Mother  with all these years and a host of experiences in observing and helping with all sorts of ailments and finding the old remedies of my mother and grand mother often times worked better than the drugs promoted by traditional doctors that only learn prescriptions and surgery in 8 years of Med. School. I started buying health books and monthly news letters by the dozens.
When modern medicine nearly killed my dear husband, not once, but two different times, I knew something needed to be done to help others that are being sickened or killed by medicine (poisons).
The book Licensed To Kill practically wrote itself  it took barely over a week. The title of the book, the names of each chapter just fell into place. Even the cover design of prescription containers was done without much thought on my part. (Divine intervention?) The only addition was Chapter 9, Here We Go Again, which personally proved, one more time, what a natural cure (iodine) can do by regulating the pulse, and what medical drugs and procedures cannot do.
I&#39;m still reading health books and Newsletters. After all, Natural cures (with no side effects) have been around for literally thousands of years. Drugs and Prescriptions (with many side effects, including death, are relatively new). 
The Pharmaceutical Companies do not want you well. Why would they? They make their Big Bucks when you are ill and buying their Drugs." />
