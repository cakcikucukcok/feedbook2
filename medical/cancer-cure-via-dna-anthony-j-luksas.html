  <title>Cancer Cure Via Dna - Anthony J Luksas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For decades now, treatment for cancer has been limited to radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, and herbal remediesall of which offering only a small measure of hope for recovery. Now, however, there may be another option with even better results. Author &lt;strong&gt;Anthony J. Luksas, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;, has dedicated over fifty years to research for not just a treatment, but a cure. His decades in the field have led him to the discovery of the ages: a road map to a cure for cancer using DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1953 by Watson and Crick, the DNA double helix has been thought of as the language of God. From that point on, throughout the ensuing decades, research has decoded much of that language, giving scientists a more respectable insight into the paradox of life itself. Now, furthering that insight, Dr. Luksas has determined a means of using that language to address cancer and perhaps other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a wealth of information on DNA and how it functions in the body, as well as other processes important to the replication of cancerous bodies such as cell respiration and metastasis, Dr. Luksas explains his findings with the common reader in mind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
