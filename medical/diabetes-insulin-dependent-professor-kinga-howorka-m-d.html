  <title>Diabetes? Insulin-Dependent?... - Professor Kinga Howorka M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Insulin-dependent?...&lt;p&gt;
In addition to the introduction to Functional Insulin Treatment for physicians (K. Howorka, Springer Publishers Berlin), this book presents guidelines for people with diabetes to treat their condition using Functional Insulin Treatment.&lt;p&gt;
Only after meticulous reading of this manual does it become clear, how many already well-known facts and other things that have never been heard of before, have been put here together in a methodological whole. Contradictions that you may have experienced personally suddenly become strikingly clear in this context. After a short self-testing period with FIT, the fear of completely inexplicable blips in your blood glucose is overcome, and you can feel selfassured, since you know the causes and provide solutions. FIT is the most modern and effective method to facilitate the control of insulin
requiring diabetes. With FIT, sometimes you do not even have to
know the basics on how to multiply. Philosophies and esoteric
recommendations are replaced by a couple of numbers with which
you can calculate. Although the problems remain the same, FIT offers you an intelligent and practical possibility of solving them by summarizing all of the treatment possibilities available today. W.D., after 48 years with diabetes
DiabetesFIT is a registered trademark for Functional Insulin
Treatment, related media and education.&lt;p&gt;
...only with Dr. Howorkas FIT therapy I was able to ascend the Mount Everest, the highest mountain of the world and to fulfill the dream of my life...&lt;p&gt;
