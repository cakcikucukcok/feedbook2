  <title>To Save Humanity: What Matters Most for a Healthy Future - Julio Frenk, Steven Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The UN was not created to take mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell. --Dag Hammarskjold, United Nations Secretary-General 1953-1961  The turn of the 21st century was an objective low point in the history of human health: AIDS was scourging Africa, millions of women died each year in child birth, and billions suffered under malnourishment and poverty. In response, the United Nations launched its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), an ambitious charter that since 2000 has measurably reduced the worldwide burdens of poverty, hunger, and disease.  With the MDGs set to expire in 2015, continued progress on these fronts is anything but certain. In addition to the persisting threats of the 20th century, globalization has sped the development of new threats--pandemics, climate change, chronic disease--that now threaten rich and poor countries equally.  To Save Humanity is a collection of short, honest essays on what single issue matters most for the future of global health. Authored by the worlds leading voices from science, politics, and social advocacy, this collection is both a primer on the major issues of our time and a potential blueprint for post-2015 health and development. This unparalleled collection will provide illuminating and thought-provoking reading for anyone invested in our collective future and well-being." />
