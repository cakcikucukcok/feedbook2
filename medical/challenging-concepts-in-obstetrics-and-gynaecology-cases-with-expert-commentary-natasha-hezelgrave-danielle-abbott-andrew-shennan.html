  <title>Challenging Concepts in Obstetrics and Gynaecology: Cases with Expert Commentary - Natasha Hezelgrave, Danielle Abbott, Andrew Shennan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Challenging Concepts in Obstetrics and Gynaecology is a case-based guide to difficult scenarios faced in both fields, covering many of the major sub-speciality areas of each.  The 24 cases have been selected to cover a spectrum of challenges in obstetrics and gynaecology.  Recognising that any attempt to cover the whole curriculum is impossible, the authors have instead chosen specific, challenging scenarios that are commonly encountered in clinicalpractice, but by no means have simple answers or outcomes.  Complex cases are examined from a multidisciplinary approach with consideration of diagnostic procedures, practical skills, evidence base, and the application of national and international guidelines. There is also a summary of evidence from the medical literature in various subspecialty areas of obstetrics and gynaecology, alongside current controversies in management. Cases are punctuated by easy-to-read Learning Points, Clinical Tips, and Evidence Base boxes, speeding the learningprocess as well as providing a handy dip-into guide for those just refreshing their memory. Each case is set off by an Expert Commentary written by an internationally-renowned expert in each field, leaving the reader with both a solid base of knowledge and a nuanced view of current challenges in obstetrics and gynaecology. This collaboration between trainees and experts provides a unique insight into the management of complex and often rare but important obstetrics and gynaecology cases, within a highly user-friendly format and a ready-made means of self-learning and self-testing.Challenging Concepts in Obstetrics and Gynaecologymakes a useful, relevant and interesting read, enabling the reader to readily transfer the knowledge gained to everyday clinical practice." />
