  <title>Inflammation Mastery 4th Edition: The Colorful and Definitive Guide Toward Health and Vitality and away from the Boredom, Risks, Costs, and Inefficacy - Alex Vasquez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inflammation Mastery 4th Edition combines the recently updated Functional Inflammology and Dr Vasquez&amp;rsquo;s previous Integrative Rheumatology into a new colorized updated textbook of almost 1,200 pages. This work is the culmination of several thousand research publications combined with Dr Vasquez&amp;rsquo;s many years of clinical experience and teaching graduate-level students and doctorate-level clinicians worldwide. With radiographs, photos, acronyms, illustrations, flowcharts, and detailed-yet-simplifying explanations, Dr Vasquez makes it easier than ever for clinicians to grasp important concepts in integrative care and functional medicine and then to translate the basic science research and molecular biology into treatment plans that can be explained and used in &amp;ldquo;the real world&amp;rdquo; of clinical practice with patients. The associated video tutorials and recorded live conference presentations further help students and clinicians &amp;ldquo;get it&amp;rdquo; via Dr Vasquez&amp;rsquo;s effective teaching style which embraces complexity while always emphasizing clinical applicability and psychosocial context. The Inflammation Mastery &amp;amp; Functional Inflammology series of books and videos translates important concepts and nutritional/biomedical science into easy and practical clinical applications for the prevention and treatment of disorders of sustained inflammation, which Dr Vasquez describes as &amp;ldquo;patterns of metabolic disturbance and inflammatory dysfunction&amp;rdquo; existing in three sequential and overlapping categories: 1) metabolic inflammation, 2) allergic inflammation, 3) autoimmune inflammation. This book includes access to video presentations which introduce the origin and components of the Functional Inflammology Protocol and FINDSEX&amp;reg; acronym. Post-publication updates to this information and important social and clinical contextualization are made available in videos and online repositories (access provided in the book), and the e-newsletter available from InflammationMastery and FunctionalInflammology.com. This textbook also provides access, via reprints or hyperlinks, to Dr Vasquez&amp;rsquo;s published articles&amp;mdash;an example of which is his recent paradigm-shifting editorial published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine (2014 January). The updated section on pain management allows students and clinicians to understand and apply manual, pharmacologic, nutritional and botanical medicine treatments for musculoskeletal pain, thereby providing better relief for patients and avoiding the hazards of NSAIDs, coxibs, steroids, opioids, immunosuppressants/immunoparalytics and biologics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
