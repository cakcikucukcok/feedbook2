  <title>Pediatric and Adult Nutrition in Chronic Diseases, Developmental Disabilities, and Hereditary Metabolic Disorders - Shirley W. Ekvall, Valli K. Ekvall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Packed with information that is useful on a daily basis. This book will be useful for all who care for children with disabilities or chronic disase.&quot; --&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong/&gt;
Food and nutrition studies are more relevant to the practice of medicine than ever before. As scientific understanding of these links has expanded over the last decade, the need for an authoritative reference has never been greater.
This fully revised and updated edition of PEDIATRIC AND ADULT NUTRITION IN CHRONIC DISEASES, DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, AND HEREDITARY METABOLIC DISORDERS offers a comprehensive reference to the nutritional interventions for diseases across the lifespan. Comprising more than 60 topic-based chapters from leading figures in nutrition and medicine, this book is the most up-to-date work on diet as a symptom of, and therapy for, chronic, hereditary, and developmental disorders.
Enriched with tables and charts that distill the latest recommendations for nutrient intake, physical activity, this third edition is a convenient and essential resource for busy clinicians and students in nutrition, dietetics, and medical specialties." />
