  <title>Cancer Caregivers - Allison J. Applebaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Informal caregivers - family members, friends, and other loved ones - are an essential, uncompensated and significantly burdened extension of the healthcare team. Rapid advances in cancer care, including new drugs and immunotherapies and more sophisticated diagnostic tools, have markedly improved the ability to medically extend lives and enhance survival. As patients are living longer, with today&#39;s shorter hospital stays and shift towards increased outpatient care, however, the demands placed on all caregivers and their needs have substantially increased.
&lt;em&gt;Cancer Caregivers&lt;/em&gt; reveals the field of Psycho-Oncology&#39;s exploration of the depth of complexities of caregiving experiences and identifies the vast expanses left to be understood. This text describes the characteristics and experiences of cancer caregivers based on their life stage, relationship to the patient, and ethnic group membership, as well as patients&#39; disease and treatment type. It highlights the significant progress in research focused on the development and dissemination of psychosocial interventions for cancer caregivers, and includes in-depth case studies to illustrate their delivery and application. The text also explores the provision of support to caregivers in the community and the legal and ethical concerns faced by caregivers throughout the caregiving process. &lt;em&gt;Cancer Caregivers &lt;/em&gt;offers both fundamental and practical information and is the essential resource for all healthcare professionals who work with patients and families facing cancer." />
