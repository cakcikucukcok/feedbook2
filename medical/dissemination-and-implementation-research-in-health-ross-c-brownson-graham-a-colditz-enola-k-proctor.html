  <title>Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health - Ross C. Brownson, Graham A. Colditz, Enola K. Proctor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;The definitive work in D&amp;amp;I research -- now completely updated and expanded&lt;/strong&gt;
The application of scientific research to the creation of evidence-based policies is a science unto itself -- and one that is never easy. Dissemination and implementation research (D&amp;amp;I) is the study of how scientific advances can be implemented into everyday life, and understanding how it works has never been more important for students and professionals across the scientific, academic, and governmental communities.
DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH IN HEALTH is a practical guide to making research more consequential, a collection assembled and written by today&#39;s leading D&amp;amp;I researchers. Readers of this book are taught to:
&amp;#183; Evaluate the evidence base in an effective intervention
&amp;#183; Choose a strategy that produces the greatest impact
&amp;#183; Design an appropriate and effectual study
&amp;#183; Track essential outcomes
&amp;#183; Account for the barriers to uptake in communities, social service agencies, and health care facilities
The challenges to moving research into practice are universal, and they&#39;re complicated by the current landscape&#39;s reliance on partnerships and multi-center research. In this light, DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH IN HEALTH is nothing less than a roadmap to effecting change in the sciences. It will have broad utility to researchers and practitioners in epidemiology, biostatistics, behavioral science, economics, medicine, social work, psychology, and anthropology -- both today and in our slightly better future." />
