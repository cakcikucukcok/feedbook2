  <title>Plastic Surgery Nursing - American Nurses Association, American Society of Plastic Surgical Nurses</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Plastic and reconstructive surgery is a growing trend in the U.S. Advancements in the field are making procedures more attractive options to an increasing number of Americans. With this growing trend, there is a growing demand for nurses working in this specialty. Although most patients opt to have surgery voluntarily, there are patients who require plastic and reconstructive surgery due to fires, accidents or deformities at birth. Plastic and reconstructive surgery can help restore patients’ appearances and, at the same time, their self-esteem. Plastic surgery nurses help victims rebuild their lives. This is one of the rewards of working in this field. Plastic surgery nurses assist in pre-op education and procedures with patients, assist during the actual procedures, and also care for patients during the post-op and recovery period.
This concise guide to contemporary plastic surgery nursing practice contains up-to-date information for RNs practicing in this nursing specialty and defines the level of nursing practice and professional performance for plastic surgery nurses at all practice levels and in all settings.
This is a must-have title for plastic surgery nursing practitioners, educators, students, researchers and others directly involved in plastic surgery. Employers, insurers, lawyers, regulators, policy makers and stakeholders will find value in referencing this publication." />
