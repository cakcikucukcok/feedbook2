  <title>Statins Toxic Side Effects: Evidence from 500 scientific papers - David Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book uses evidence from 500 scientific papers that show, incontrovertibly, that statins not only do not improve health but cause actual harm and should be avoided. &quot;?¢ The disturbing effects of statins on death rates, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer. &quot;?¢ Statins are a health disaster for those with an underactive thyroid. &quot;?¢ How statins cause muscle disease, kidney disease, liver disease, pancreatitis and multiorgan failure. &quot;?¢ The dire consequences of statin use on the nervous system. &quot;?¢ Autoimmune diseases, arthritis and skin infections may result from statin use. &quot;?¢ Evidence is presented that reveal statins are deleterious for those that have asthma and lung diseases. &quot;?¢ Exercise performance is severely restricted by the use of the drug. &quot;?¢ People taking statins are found to have a &quot;??foggy&quot;?? brain, depression and an increased risk of violence and suicidal thoughts. &quot;?¢ Statins can damage your eyes and give you headaches. &quot;?¢ They can make men impotent, damage sperm quality and cause birth defects. &quot;?¢ Bowel problems, urinary tract infections and other general infections are exacerbated with statin use. &quot;?¢ Bone structure may be compromised and tendon rupture is more common when using the drug. These 500 studies underline the judgement of the internationally renowned cardiologist, Dr Michel de Lorgeril, who said about statins: &quot;??We&quot;??ll come to the inevitable conclusion in the end that these drugs are unnecessary and toxic, they must be removed from the market.&quot;?" />
