Horowitz, one of the country&#39;s foremost doctors, comes a ground-breaking book about diagnosing, treating and healing Lyme, and peeling away the layers that lead to chronic disease.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you sick, but can&#39;t find any answers why? Do you have a seemingly unconnected collection of symptoms that leave doctors guessing? Or have you been diagnosed, but found that none of the treatments seems to make a difference? You may have Lyme disease and not even know it. Known as &quot;the great imitator,&quot; Lyme disease and its associated co-infections can mimic the symptoms of and often be misdiagnosed as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and even depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his landmark book, &lt;i&gt;Why Can&#39;t I Get Better?: Solving the Mystery of Lyme &amp; Chronic Disease&lt;/i&gt;, renowned internist and leading world expert Dr. Horowitz introduced his revolutionary plan for treating Lyme disease, and chronic diseases in general. Now, in this new handbook &lt;i&gt;How Can I Get Better?&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Horowitz updates his research and offers a direct, actionable step-by-step plan for implementing his 16 MSIDS Diagnostic Map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will find:&lt;br&gt;*The latest pertinent information on the most important scientific discoveries &lt;br&gt;*Emerging research on bacterial &quot;persisters&quot;--bacteria that can survive antibiotics--and new therapies to get rid of them&lt;br&gt;*A seven-step action plan that patients and doctors can follow to ensure better health.&lt;/p&gt;" />
