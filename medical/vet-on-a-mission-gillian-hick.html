  <title>Vet On A Mission - Gillian Hick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the imminent arrival of her third child, veterinary surgeon, Gillian Hick, decides to abandon the perils of mixed animal practice, in a favour of setting up a small animal practice from home. When neighbouring farmer, John Armstrong, drops in for a cup of tea and stays to build the new veterinary clinic, the dream becomes a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the practice begins to take on a life of its own, the practicalities of running a twenty-four/seven on call business, with the help of her husband and her three exuberantly, enthusiastic pre-school children begins to take its toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From hatching goslings on a moonlit night, to late night calls to celebrity donkeys; from delivering new-borns, to assisting in the final farewells of much-loved patients, the circle of life continues as Gillian struggles to hang on to, not only her sense of humour, but also the last remaining threads of her sanity!&lt;/p&gt;" />

The book is a bit like reading Gillians notes, Its not awful as there are some interesting stories but as Gillian says shes happier with the animals than the owners and this shows in her writing.<br /><b><i>Vet on a Mission by Gillian Hick - Goodreads</i></b> | Gillian Hick was born in Dublin and has practised as a vet both in Dublin and in Wicklow for the many years. She also works for the Irish Blue Cross. She lives in Co. Wicklow, where she has her own practice, with her husband, three children, and a large assortment of four-legged companions.<br /><b><i>Vet On A Mission: Hick, Gillian: 9781788490269: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | Gillian Hick was born in Dublin and has practised as a vet both in Dublin and in Wicklow for the many years.
