  <title>Electrodiagnosis in Diseases of Nerve and Muscle: Principles and Practice - Jun Kimura M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Building on the author&#39;s personal experience in working with fellows and residents in the electromyography laboratory, this volume is the definitive reference in the field. It is intended for clinicians who perform electrodiagnostic procedures as an extension of their clinical examination, and will be of value to neurologists and physiatrists who are interested in neuromuscular disorders and noninvasive electrodiagnostic methods, particularly those practicing electromyography (EMG).  The book provides a comprehensive review of most peripheral nerve and muscle diseases, including specific techniques and locations for performing each test.  Divided into two major sections, the first addresses the basics of electrodiagnosis, including information on anatomy and physiology, techniques for nerve conduction studies, and discussions of the blink reflex and H-reflex, etc.  The second section presents each neuromuscular disorder, covering clinical aspects and extensive information on the distinctive electrophysiological findings typical of the disease.  New for this edition: thorough updating of all chapters with extensive new references; entirely new sections on magnetic stimulation, human reflexes, late responses, quantitative EMG, motor unit number estimate, threshold electrotonus, and pediatric electrodiagnosis; consolidated yet comprehensive coverage of periperhal, as well as CNS studies, offering a practical approach for problem-solving; ample space allotted for clinical discussion." />
