  <title>Medical Equipment and Supply Business - J.S. Spratley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written for those with a passion for business, but lacks the knowledge or understanding of the process of getting started. It is written to give its readers a comprehensive view of the medical equipment and supply business and what it takes to be successful in this very profitable field.
This book was written as a step by step medical equipment and supply business guide for those in pursuit of a business venture to start. The book is structured to give its readers the exact steps to follow as they are written in the book. It is very important to follow these steps in the order that they appear. 
This book is to give those with very little to no knowledge of business, let alone the medical equipment and supply field. Its intent is give the reader an insight of starting and successfully operating a medical equipment and supply company. Our goal is to teach everyone (who is interested in starting a business in the medical field) the same knowledge as those who have been in the business for years. This book gives you the same information that the large corporations had when they started out as a small one person operation, just as you are today. It gives the readers only the necessary information needed, and not a lot of useless word to only fill a book. On each page there are different topics, which cover information necessary for the growth of your business. It also gives the reader contact information on where you will go to complete whatever it is that that section may call for. For example; the zoning section (called zoning requirement), this will have directly under it location of where to go to register. This book also list medical supply and equipment companies with phone numbers and web addresses of each company. This book is very user friendly, and very informative.
This book also covers what products to sell, who do you sell to, and finding the person you need to contact when calling on these businesses. 
Enjoy this valuable information, and much success in your business endeavors." />
