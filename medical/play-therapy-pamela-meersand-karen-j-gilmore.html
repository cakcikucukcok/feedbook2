  <title>Play Therapy - Pamela Meersand, Karen J. Gilmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Play Therapy: A Psychodynamic Primer for the Treatment of Young Children provides a contemporary, comprehensive exploration of the theory and technique of psychoanalytically oriented play therapy, addressing both the dearth of writings on these topics and the frequent lack of in-depth education on the basic principles and practice of psychodynamic play therapy offered by contemporary training programs for child clinicians.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Divided into two distinct parts, this guide covers major theoretical issues -- including the role of play in human development, the application of basic psychodynamic concepts to work with young children, and the impact of contemporary techno-culture on play -- and offers pragmatic guidance on conducting play treatment and handling the complexities of treating young patients (e.g., initiating treatment, working with parents, managing aggression in the playroom).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Among the book&#39;s standout features are:  ? An abundance of clinical vignettes that illustrate childhood behaviors, common dilemmas, and potential therapist responses? A summary of key concepts at the end of each chapter that underscores major takeaways and can be easily referenced by busy clinicians? A glossary of key terms for each chapter for added comprehensibility &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Offering a skillful balance of broad but coherent foundational information as well as practical application, Play Therapy: A Psychodynamic Primer for the Treatment of Young Children functions both as an introduction for young therapists and as a guide for more experienced child clinicians who wish to expand their knowledge of play and its therapeutic potential.&lt;/P&gt;" />
