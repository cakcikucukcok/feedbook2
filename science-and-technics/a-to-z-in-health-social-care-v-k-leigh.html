  <title>A to Z in Health &amp; Social Care - V. K. Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an A-to-Z dictionary type of glossary book that contains the everyday words and vocabulary used in the environments of social care, sheltered housing, extra care, social housing, and related environments. Words that people use every day and are taken for granted without thinking about what they mean or represent. Most of the staffs, clients, patients, and visitors use these words so frequently and indiscriminately that to some people, they have lost the true meanings and understandings. This book is of educational value to training establishments and colleges that educate pupils in health and social care, social housing, extra care, sheltered housing, care sectors. It is a source of reference when unsure about the terms of words that are being used or pronounced. It is important to realise that this is not a textbook but only a reference sourcethat is, a dictionary.
This A-to-Z dictionary format is a book that can be used on daily basis, useful during studies and in the place of work. This book is set up in alphabetical order. Each section starts with words of wisdom (quotations from the Book of Proverbs). The facts and the usefulness of this information come very handy and are knowledgeable and educational. This is a must-have book on the bookshelf at home and at place of work for easy referencing. Thank you, Wikipedia, for your immense contribution in every way. The way of progress is neither swift nor easy." />
