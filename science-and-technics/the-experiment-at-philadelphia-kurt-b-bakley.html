  <title>The Experiment at Philadelphia - Kurt B. Bakley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Experiment at Philadelphia
Did Einstein discover God? If God created all things, then who Created God? What Was and Happened Before the Big-Bang.
The Philadelphia Experiment was Einsteins experiment in which he had not only discovered, in 1943, the way to make things invisible and transport them at great speeds but also positively proven scientifically, physically, and spiritually that the Almighty God exists! He had literally discovered God! 
That question, is there a god? Thats been going through peoples minds for so long, was discussed on the street corner, talked about on the porch on a hot summers night, and is now a proven fact. Yes, there is a god! 
Did Einstein in the Philadelphia Experiment make contact with UFO beings, who gave him advance knowledge of all things, which Einstein later destroyed, fearing what the world would do with that knowledge? Are the first fourteen chapters of this book about the advance knowledge Einstein received? Does it reveal the deepest, darkest secrets of God and Satan and how the universe works? Does it answer these questions? 
Many have asked since the beginning of the world: Which is known as the mystery of God? Why am I here? Whats the true meaning of life? How was everything created? Who are God and the devil? If God created all, who created God? If he is the first in creation, where and how did he come into existence? Why does God allow evil in the world? Why do good things happen to bad people and bad things to good people? Whyif we all came from Adam and Eve, who were Jewishare there Gentiles? Are Gentiles children of devils? Is that why the Jews are Gods chosen race? Why in the Garden of Eden was the knowledge of good on the tree forbidden? How old is the earth? Why is God known as the Trinity? Why have religions, down through the ages, done such evil? What, when, and how did the big bang start? What happened to Satan? Who is he really, and what did he do in the past? What are his beliefs and ways? What is he and God literally made of? What is the meaning of the great pyramids and the sphinx? Is there scientific proof that God exists? 
Read this whole book for the answers to all these tough questions, and be sure to read the introduction first before reading the rest of this book. It will help you better understand this whole book." />
