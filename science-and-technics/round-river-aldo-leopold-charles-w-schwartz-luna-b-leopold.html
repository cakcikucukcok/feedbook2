  <title>Round River - Aldo Leopold, Charles W. Schwartz, Luna B. Leopold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To those who know the charm of Aldo Leopolds writing in A Sand County Almanac, this collection from his journals and essays will be a new delight.  The journal entries included here were written in camp during his many field trips--hunting, fishing, and exploring--and they indicate the source of ideas on land ethics found in his longer essays.  They reflect as well two long canoe trips in Canada and a sojourn in Mexico, where Leopold hunted deer with bow and arrow.  The essays presented here are culled from the more contemplative notes which were still in manuscript form at the time of Leopolds death in 1948, fighting a brush fire on a neighbors farm.      Round River has been edited by Leopolds son, Luna, a geologist well-known in the field of conservation.  It is also charmingly illustrated with line drawings by Charles W. Schwartz.  All admirers of Leopolds work--indeed, all lovers of nature--will find this book richly rewarding." />
