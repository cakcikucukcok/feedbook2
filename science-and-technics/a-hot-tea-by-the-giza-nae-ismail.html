  <title>A Hot  Tea  by  the  Giza - Nae Ismail</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Release			July 13, 2010
Dear friends and colleagues,
After a monthly delay, my book A HOT TEA BY THE GIZA  The Real Global Warming, not CO2 hoax is released in soft cover by US publisher iUniverse. I also routinely blog on Toronto Examiner.com about global warming and CO2-GHG fallacy. I belong to Linkedln.com where Cancun, Mexico December 2010 climate conference is starting to catch much attention.
Addressed to young adolescents who will be confronted full on by escalating Global Warming, the book explains a number of issues such as;
1.	energy science not keeping pace with energy use brings global warming,
2.	polar ice and alpine glaciers mop up human activity generated heat thankfully,
3.	at 0 C they clamp Earth temperature to underpin a fluid circulatory cooling,
4.	misunderstood centripetal force spawns and sustains all cyclonic swirls,
5.	low ambient heat must exit in storm kinetic energy, not radiation as believed,
6.	unproven CO2 - greenhouse (GHG) warming theory is scientifically flawed,
7.	cloud colour by internal light reflection depends on moisture cooling rate,
8.	abrupt cold dry atmospheric downburst colliding with heat jump starts a tornado, 
9.	surreptitious Bermuda Triangle and flight disappearances without warning,
10.	Jet Stream and all other celestial ferocious dust storms share same AGBC origin,
11.	radiation is pulsating E-M energy field transmission, not particles in motion, 
12.	sunlight is an ultra-broadband E-M energy field broadcast, not a photon beam,
13.	Earths magnetic field is born out of the Ionosphere by a relative rotation,
14.	intrusive rockets and jet flights intolerably scramble a fragile upper atmosphere
15.	dry ionic upper climate reigns over a moisture activated troposphere weather, 
16.	solutions to reverse global warming and impending calamity unless remedied,
17.	a hypothesis on nuclear structure to explain gamma ray (?) emission in fission,
18.	etc. etc.
Meant for your 2010 summer leisure reading, hopefully it will be your travel companion in days ahead and become a memento to your children and grand kids when they need a handy reference on this trans-generational scourge of modernity that we have incurred but without leaving them neither a solution, nor even a handle to begin finding one.
On that cheery note I appreciate with humility your interest and patronage. Kind regards.
