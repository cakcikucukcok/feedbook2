  <title>Beyond Oil - Kenneth S. Deffeyes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;This book explains both why the decline of our most precious fuel is inevitable and how challenging it will be to cope with what comes next.&quot;--Richard E. Smalley, University Professor, Rice University, and 1996 Nobel laureate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With world oil production about to peak and inexorably head toward steep decline, what fuels are available to meet rising global energy demands? That question, once thought to address a fairly remote contingency, has become ever more urgent, as a spate of books has drawn increased public attention to the imminent exhaustion of the economically vital world oil reserves. Kenneth S. Deffeyes, a geologist who was among the first to warn of the coming oil crisis, now takes the next logical step and turns his attention to the earth&#39;s supply of potential replacement fuels. In &lt;i&gt;Beyond Oil&lt;/i&gt;, he traces out their likely production futures, with special reference to that of oil, utilizing the same analytic tools developed by his former colleague, the pioneering petroleum-supply authority M. King Hubbert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The bad news in this book is made bearable by the author&#39;s witty, conversational writing style. If my college econ textbooks had been written this way, I might have learned economics.&quot; --Rupert Cutler, &lt;i&gt;The Roanoke Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
