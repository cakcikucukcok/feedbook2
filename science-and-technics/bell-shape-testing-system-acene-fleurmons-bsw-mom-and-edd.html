  <title>Bell-Shape Testing System - Acene Fleurmons Bsw  Mom  and EdD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about a presentation of Benjamin Blooms Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Cognitive Domain. It rather wants to be a research paper in which I make a profound reflection on the educational objectives presented by Bloom in 1956. I take the opportunity to seek knowledge or information on how they are implemented by the schools. The greatest opportunity Ive had is to indicate how these educational objectives should be implemented in lifelong learning so students of any age, especially in the public schools, can have insights into them for their full success.
This book also contains some critics of Blooms text related to the classification of the objectives. For example, comprehension cannot be classified immediately after knowledge because one needs to develop some mental and intellectual efforts before he or she can be confident with having insight into anything. This stage of knowing is based on the analysis of the encountered facts." />
