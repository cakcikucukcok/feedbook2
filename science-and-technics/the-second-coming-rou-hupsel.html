  <title>The Second Coming - Roué Hupsel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the dark shadows of Neptune and Pluto, suddenly an unknown planet emerges, which after a cycle lasting thousands of years, has returned to our solar system, visible
from Earth at night as a small star. With her arrival, Nibiru, as the ancients in pre-historic times called her, brings a horror that will afflict the earthlings as never before.
&lt;br&gt;
Those, whom our ancestors considered gods, have returned to reclaim their legacy. No weapon can withstand this invasion, which is not of material nature and will mercilessly strike the non-physical part of man  his soul!
&lt;br&gt;
An American scholar specialized in ancient languages, discovers an obscure inscription and image on a clay tablet from ancient Sumer, where mention is made of the return of the gods, who stood at the beginning of the birth of humanity. This discovery opens his eyes to the indescribable terrifying truths, leading to an on madness bordering cognizance that takes its toll and leads to his death. His son, assisted by a wise Indian shaman, begins an almost impossible battle against unknown sinister threatening powers that attack humanity in the core. Thousands of humans are being evicted from their corporeal body. When these completely unknown entities approach the inhabitants of the White House and attack the president, one fears the worst.
&lt;br&gt;
A possible salvation of mankind is hidden in mysterious images and petroglyphs on the Gateway of the Sun in Tiahuanaco, Bolivia. A journey full of strange and terrifying events leads the two men to bewildering, unfathomable answers to questions far beyond their intellect.
&lt;br&gt;
In Siloam Springs, a little town in the United States, a fierce battle takes place, in which a small boy with incredible psychic powers, hopefully, can turn the tide, provided that both men could wrest the truth from the darkness of oblivion:the unknown past of mankind." />
