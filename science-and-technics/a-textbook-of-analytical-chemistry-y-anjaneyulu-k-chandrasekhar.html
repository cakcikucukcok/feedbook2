  <title>A Textbook of Analytical Chemistry - Y. Anjaneyulu, K. Chandrasekhar </title>
      <meta name="description" content="Analytical Chemistry plays a vital role in many disciplines like Chemistry, Physics, Biology and industrial process. Scientists, engineers and technicians in all fields of Chemistry, Biotechnology, Water Resources, Engineering and Medicine often need information from chemical analysis. In addition, after the analysis is done, interpretation of the data is complicated and plays a major role. The present book is for providing training to analytical chemists in various modern analytical methods, which is a major task for Universities, Industrial organizations and government laboratories because of the rapid growth in new techniques, and necessity of analyzing multi-complex samples in short time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Salient Features&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Many of the topics are presented with thorough background of related chemical principle&lt;br /&gt;
* Wide range of new analytical techniques that are useful in modern analytical chemistry are presented in this book, so that necessary confidence can be acquired to obtain high quality analytical data&lt;br /&gt;
* Basic principles of Gravimetric, Volumetric Analysis with latest developments and Statistical Treatment of Analytical data are provided&lt;br /&gt;
* Atomic absorption, inductively couple plasma spectroscopy and flame photometry are presented with details of design, fabrication and operational variables and their applications are presented with good examples&lt;br /&gt;
* Electroanalytical method are given in detail and discussed with their specific applications" />
