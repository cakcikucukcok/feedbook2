  <title>Fundamentals of the General Theory of the Universe - Vladimir (Waldemar) Groo (Groh)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fundamentals of the General Theory of the Universe builds upon knowledge empirically obtained by mankind. In doing so, it interprets phenomena that have until now lacked definitive explanation, such as superconductivity and propagation of electromagnetic waves in conductor and in vacuum; the book also resolves the dilemma of the well-known wave-practical dualism. For the first time ever, this book answers the question, What is gravitational interaction? The book points out the connection between our material world and the world of elementary particles, as exemplified by n0?1H1. Here one will find classification of matter and its creation. The author underscores the universal character of the laws of energy distribution at all matter levels. The levels themselves are triune and built in the image and after the likeliness. This book is the first attempt ever at combining all natural sciences and stepping out of the bounds of generally accepted concepts." />
