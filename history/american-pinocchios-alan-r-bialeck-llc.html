      <meta name="description" content="It is commonly alleged that politicians misrepresent events for their own gain, but very few (if any) critics can produce facts to support their allegations. Have Democrats knowingly misrepresented George W. Bush&#39;s involvement in stealing an election, getting us into the Iraq War, and causing the 2008 financial crisis? An analyst separates fact from fiction. For example, the Financial Crisis Commission Report, which purports to explain the cause of the 2008 financial crisis with detailed facts, fails to support its own conclusions.   The author therefore challenges readers to carefully parse through the facts within to reach their own conclusions. To rely on any third party to interpret events is a surrender of political independence and intellectual freedoms.
