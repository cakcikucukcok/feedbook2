  <title>The Future Has an Ancient Heart - Lucia Chiavola Birnbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Feminist cultural historian Lucia Chiavola Birnbaum caps her previous work with &lt;i&gt;The Future has an Ancient Heart&lt;/i&gt;, a scholarly study of the transformative legacy of African origins and values of caring, sharing, healing, and vision carried by African migrants throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birnbaum focuses on the long endurance of these values from the first human communities in south and central Africa, ones that Africans manifested in the region of the African mediterranean landmass that later separated Africa from Europe and Asia when the ice melted and waters rose. These migrants reached every continent and later became spiritual as well as geograpical migrations back to Africa, from ancient times to the transformative present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same methods as her teaching, Birnbaum employs a mutual learning process in her work to help us think about our own ancestral story, adding to the wisdom we need to surmount contemporary crises and give us the energy to help bring a more equal and just world into being. Her methodologies are grounded on empirical techniques of science and the social sciences and yet leave openings for the liminal knowledge that resides underneath and beyond boundaries of established religions, secular ideologies, and conventional science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true work of transformation, &lt;i&gt;The Future has an Ancient Heart&lt;/i&gt; opens the door to new possibilities within our world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
