  <title>The Mission of Abbé Glasberg in the French Resistance during WWII - Lucien Lazare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mission of Abb&amp;eacute; Glasberg&lt;/em&gt; is the fascinating story of a priest - of Jewish origins - who dedicated himself to the task of helping the refugees who were streaming into France during the years preceding World War II. Together with Father Chaillet, Abb&amp;eacute; Glasberg created the ecumenical Amiti&amp;eacute; Chr&amp;eacute;tienne in May 1942 with the full support of Cardinal Gerlier, archbishop of Lyon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a joint effort, they managed to retrieve hundreds of Jewish children from French-run concentration camps and disperse them among religious houses and private homes. They refused to give them up even when the government of Vichy placed Chaillet under house arrest in a psychiatric hospital for three months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They disregarded the orders of Alexandre Angeli, the regional prefect of Lyon, who was a Nazi collaborator. Angeli was condemned to a death penalty immediately after the war, later commuted to a sentence of four year-imprisonment. Abb&amp;eacute; Glasberg later joined the French underground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the war, Abb&amp;eacute; Glasberg assisted the Mossad in their attempt to transport many of the war survivors to the land of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
