  <title>Man&#39;s Horizons - Mark Pardini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Book - Man&amp;rsquo;s Horizons - takes you on an enlightening journey of discovery that begins with the awe-inspiring cosmic explosion of the Big Bang and continues through to the Universe&amp;rsquo;s last gasp at the end of time. See how the story of Mankind is intricately interwoven into this vast cosmic backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During your journey, witness the wonders of cosmology as Nature brings planet Earth together to be a viable destination to nurture the seed of life. Follow the path of evolution from its primordial DNA roots through to the rise of Humankind. Be awed by the great determination and ingenuity of our ancient ancestors as they struggle through the ice ages, making use of tools, weapons and fire and creating language to narrowly avoid extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience the historical age of conquerors as emerging nations battle for dominance in a desperate bid to determine who will go forth and multiply and who will not. Understand how 70 centuries of human conflict forged the current mindset of the masses to be belligerent, demanding, competitive and materialistic. Consider that this disposition may prove to be disastrous when our leaders make decisions that determine our future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come to understand our world, its biosphere and the wondrous life affording bounty of its land, oceans and atmosphere. Appreciate the importance of sustainability, the bio-web and species diversity on a global scale. Take a look at the modern world&amp;rsquo;s ever mounting challenges as the human population surges toward 10 billion. By all indications we are overrunning Earth&amp;rsquo;s sustainable capacity whilst recklessly disposing of vast quantities of damaging waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a global community, will we destroy Earth&amp;rsquo;s fragile biological order and join the extinct species that have been relegated to the fossil record? Or will we rise to the intellectual challenge of our time by going forth, not to multiply but first to colonise new worlds as we reach for the Stars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider &amp;lsquo;Man&amp;rsquo;s Horizons&amp;rsquo; as humanity&amp;rsquo;s ultimate destiny. We are a unique species that has acquired the technological capability to create the roads that will carry us into the future. Our fate lies at the end of the road chosen! Which road will it be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which road will you choose? The destiny of our species lies in your hands!
