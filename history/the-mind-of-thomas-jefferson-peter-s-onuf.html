  <title>The Mind of Thomas Jefferson - Peter S. Onuf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In The Mind of Thomas Jefferson, one of the foremost historians of Jefferson and     his time, Peter S. Onuf, offers a collection of essays that seeks to historicize one of our     nation&#39;s founding fathers. Challenging current attempts to appropriate Jefferson to serve     all manner of contemporary political agendas, Onuf argues that historians must look at     Jefferson&#39;s language and life within the context of his own place and time. In this effort     to restore Jefferson to his own world, Onuf reconnects that world to ours, providing a fresh     look at the distinction between private and public aspects of his character that Jefferson     himself took such pains to cultivate. Breaking through Jefferson&#39;s alleged opacity as a     person by collapsing the contemporary interpretive frameworks often used to diagnose his     psychological and moral states, Onuf raises new questions about what was on Jefferson&#39;s     mind as he looked toward an uncertain future. Particularly striking is his argument that     Jefferson&#39;s character as a moralist is nowhere more evident, ironically, than in his     engagement with the institution of slavery. At once reinvigorating the tension between past and     present and offering a new way to view our connection to one of our nation&#39;s founders, The     Mind of Thomas Jefferson helps redefine both Jefferson and his time and American     nationhood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
