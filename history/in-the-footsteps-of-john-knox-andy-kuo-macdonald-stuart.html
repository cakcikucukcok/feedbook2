  <title>In the Footsteps of John Knox - Andy Kuo, Macdonald Stuart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Knox, Scotland&amp;rsquo;s great sixteenth-century reformer, was a man of fearless faith and unusual experiences. His faith in God turned him from a Catholic priest to a fiery Protestant preacher. His determination helped him to survive as a French galley slave, and he later served as a chaplain at King Edward VI&amp;rsquo;s court in England. His belief in sharing the living Word of God led him and other English-speaking exiles in Geneva to translate the Bible into English. This Geneva Bible immediately became the most popular English Bible of its time. Knox&amp;rsquo;s deep trust in God&amp;rsquo;s living Word, and his charismatic preaching, boosted the morale of the Protestant movements in Scotland and eventually led to the successful establishment of Protestantism there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book will take you on a twofold journey: first and foremost, a journey to discover the life and faith of John Knox, a man who prevailed against difficulties and challenges because of his strong faith in God. It is also a journey following Knox&amp;rsquo;s footsteps to the towns of Haddington, St Andrews, Perth, Stirling, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Frankfurt, Dieppe, and Geneva. In each town, readers will encounter the churches, castles, and historical sites that held special significance to Knox. Maps, photos and historical background are included to help readers become acquainted with the places introduced.&lt;/p&gt;" />
