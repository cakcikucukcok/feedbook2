  <title>Not Even My Name - Thea Halo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A riveting account of exile from Turkish genocide, brought to light for the first time ever in Sano Halo&#39;s personal story &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not Even My Name&lt;/i&gt; exposes the genocide carried out during and after WW I in Turkey, which brought to a tragic end the 3000-year history of the Pontic Greeks (named for the Pontic Mountain range below the Black Sea). During this time, almost 2 million Pontic Greeks and Armenians were slaughtered and millions of others were exiled.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not Even My Name&lt;/i&gt; is the unforgettable story of Sano Halo&#39;s survival, as told to her daughter, Thea, and of their trip to Turkey in search of Sano&#39;s home 70 years after her exile.  Sano Halo was a 10-year-old girl when she was torn from her ancient, pastoral way of life in the mountains and sent on a death march that annihilated her family. Stripped of everything she had ever held dear, even her name, Sano was sold by her surrogate family into marriage when still a child to a man three times her age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not Even My Name&lt;/i&gt; follows Sano&#39;s marriage, the raising of her ten children in New York City, and her transformation as an innocent girl who was forced to move from a bucolic life to the 20th century in one bold stride. Written in haunting and eloquent prose, &lt;i&gt;Not Even My Name&lt;/i&gt; weaves a seamless texture of individual and group memory, evoking all the suspense and drama of the best told tales.&lt;/p&gt;" />
