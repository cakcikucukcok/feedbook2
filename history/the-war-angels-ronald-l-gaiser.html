  <title>The War Angels - Ronald L. Gaiser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a remote village, high in the snow-capped mountains of southern Poland, during the worst winter of World War II, a beautiful polish woman presiding over the village peasants, a brute of a partisan leader, and an outlaw priest with a mysterious past, are hiding a ragtag band of Jewish children escaped from an accidental death train wreck.
     During a Bible lesson, the priest, who is actually a Jewish doctor disguised as a man of the cloth, tells the children the Old Testament story of Elisha. God sent His special War Angels to protect the children of Israel from the attacking Syrian army he said. The children ask the priest to pray with them for War Angels, like in the Bible story, to protect them from the relentless Nazi madman searching for their capture.
     Miraculously, an American B-17 bomber carrying a tough crew of battered flyers from a deep penetration raid over Germany, crash lands directly next to the village. The children and villagers renew their faith in God, believing the Americans to be; the answer to prayer, and...The War Angels.
     In the end, most realized, only the hand of God could have brought all these people, and seemingly unrelated threads of circumstance into that perilously precise moment in time. Together, through their heroic faith, they persevere against the onslaught of evil Satanic forces" />
