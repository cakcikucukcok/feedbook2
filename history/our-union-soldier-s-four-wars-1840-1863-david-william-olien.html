  <title>Our Union Soldier’S Four Wars 1840-1863 - David William Olien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What began as an attempt to learn  about the service of a family ancestor lost in the Civil War became an exciting journey following him through two decades and a half of  some of the most  critical years in Americas history.    Irish Immigrant Peter Gregory Curry was one of the few soldiers who served his country in one of the Florida Seminole Wars, the Mexican War, Gold Rush California and finally the Civil War.
His family had no memory or record of his extraordinary life of adventure which included hard Federal military service in 1840s Florida, front line combat in the Mexican War, being shot in the shoulder in a battle with California Indians during the Gold Rush, homesteading in frontier Illinois and finally  dying as a Union officer in the Civil War.  A haunting photo he had taken for his wife and children before he went off to his final war was the only trace of him that remained 150 years later.
Using the  Federal Archives in Washington D.C. specialized history libraries  in California and Wisconsin and with significant help from amateur historians who form a unique Internet community, the author recovers  Peter Currys remarkable life  from his enlistment in New York City in 1840 to his 1863 military funeral in Civil War Arkansas." />
