  <title>The Fanciful Prince (Volume I) - Guy Boulianne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first book in the series, it narrates historical facts that are often forgotten or ignored by the general public, and they are historical facts that relate to names, dates, events and a symbolism that can hardly be refuted. As the proverb says: &quot;the force of life is sacred, invisible and powerful, contains the memory of the past and the vision of the future. It allows creation to manifest in matter here and now.&quot; For years, Guy Boulianne has scrutinized the collective memory and the memory of his being, in order to restore a truth buried deep within himself and deep within human memories. Chapter after chapter - like a diary-it leads the reader in his quest for the Grail and gives him the keys to a better understanding of the past, present and future world. With him, The Secret History of France resurfaced and was transported to the host country of New France.
Throughout the pages, the author reconstructs a little more in the history of his family, which has its origin in the most remote times and which goes back to Prince Ursus, descendant of the Merovingian King Dagobert II, Princess Visigothe Gisèle De Rhedae and the exilarch Makhir ben Habibai, representative of the powerful Babylonian Judaism. This mark of nobility is inscribed on the family coat of arms : &quot;A blue bear&#39;s paw, banded or.&quot; As Arthur on his dextrier, the Excalibur word in hand, Guy Boulianne slays the dragons-Guardians of treasures-and shares with you the substantive marrow of his research.&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;History is the witness of times, the light of truth, the life of memory, the teacher of life, the messenger of antiquity &quot; (Cicero, statesman and philosopher). &lt;br/&gt;" />
