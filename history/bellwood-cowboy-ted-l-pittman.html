  <title>Bellwood Cowboy - Ted L. Pittman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bellwood Cowboy is the life story of one of the greatest men I ever knew. Artie Quinton is one of the last of the old time cowboys. His knowledge of livestock and ranch management is renown in Oklahoma. He worked for the Daube Cattle Co. for forty seven years starting during the Great Depression era of the 1930s. Born in a log cabin in 1912 he would lose his mother before he was a year and a half old, then the grandmother who raised him when he was twelve. He attended a country school through the eighth grade. Married to the girl of his dreams, he started working for Daube Ranches in 1937 for $35 a month and that included his wife&#39;s pay for cooking three meals a day for up to twenty cowboys. Artie advanced to foreman of Daube Ranches and acquired a reputation as the best ranch manager in the area. He retired in 1984 and at 98 years of age and legally blind, lives alone in the small town of Mill Creek, Oklahoma. Artie has preached more funerals than most preachers, and is the corner stone of his church. Follow his most unique life in the pages of Bellwood Cowboy." />
