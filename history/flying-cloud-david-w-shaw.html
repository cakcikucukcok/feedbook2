  <title>Flying Cloud - David W. Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flying Cloud&lt;/em&gt; is the riveting and thoroughly researched tale of a truly unforgettable sea voyage during the days of the California gold rush. In 1851, navigator Eleanor Creesy set sail on the maiden voyage of the clipper ship &lt;em&gt;Flying Cloud&lt;/em&gt;, traveling from New York to San Francisco in only 89 days. This swift passage set a world record that went unbroken for more than a century. Upon arrival in San Francisco, &lt;em&gt;Flying Cloud&lt;/em&gt; became an enduring symbol of a young nation&#39;s daring frontier spirit. Illustrated with original maps and charts as well as historical photographs, Shaw&#39;s compelling narrative captures the drama of this thrilling adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a position almost unheard of for a woman in the mid-19th century, Eleanor Creesy served as the ship&#39;s navigator. With only the sun, planets, and stars to guide her, she brought &lt;em&gt;Flying Cloud&lt;/em&gt; safely around Cape Horn at the height of a winter blizzard, faced storms, dodged shoals, and found her way through calms to make the swift passage possible. Along with her husband, Josiah, the ship&#39;s captain, she sailed the mighty 3-masted clipper through 16,000 miles of the fiercest, most unpredictable oceans in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw vividly recreates 19th-century seafaring conditions and customs, for both the crew and the passengers who entrusted their fate to an untested ship. Including excerpts from letters and diaries of passengers, Shaw recounts &lt;em&gt;Flying Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s victory in the face of adversity&amp;#8212;including sabotage, insubordination, and severe damage to the clipper&#39;s mainmast that might have sunk her with all hands lost. But the ship triumphed and would ultimately sail the world. &lt;em&gt;Flying Cloud&lt;/em&gt; brings to life, for the first time, the glory of one of America&#39;s most important seafaring tales and one woman&#39;s incredible achievements.&lt;/p&gt;" />
