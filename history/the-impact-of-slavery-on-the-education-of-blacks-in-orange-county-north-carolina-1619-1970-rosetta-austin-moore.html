  <title>The Impact of Slavery On the Education of Blacks In Orange County, North Carolina: 1619-1970 - Rosetta Austin Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can integration break the oppression faced by Black Americans, or will it crystallize long-held images and send Blacks deeper into a spiral of dependency?   Rosetta Austin Moore, a longtime educator who taught in segregated and integrated schools, asks that question and many others in this extensive study of the education system for Blacks in North Carolina.   She traces the struggles of Blacks to survive and learn, beginning with their forced entry into the United States in 1619, drawing on primary documents, charts, illustrations, and a treasure trove of data in four appendixes.   The book reveals how a pattern of withholding information, denying access to educational opportunities, and subjecting a people to negative indoctrinations about their self-worth, their families, their race, and their place in society has damaged the Black community&#39;s desire to reach for greater heights." />
