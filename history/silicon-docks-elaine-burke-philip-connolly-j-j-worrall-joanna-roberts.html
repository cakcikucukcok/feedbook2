  <title>Silicon Docks - Elaine Burke, Philip Connolly, J.J. Worrall, Joanna Roberts...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past fifteen years, many of the world&#39;s biggest technology firms have opened offices in Dublin. But just how did the Irish government convince the likes of Google, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to set up bases in Ireland? Find out how a series of last-minute negotiations between the IDA and Google convinced Sergey Brin and Larry Page to locate their European headquarters in Ireland instead of Switzerland. Discover the difficulty Facebook faced when it tried to register its company name in Ireland, as another firm had a similar name. Learn how a tweet to Twitter co-founder Biz Stone helped woo the social media platform. In Silicon Docks, a team of Irish journalists tell the inside story of how Dublin&#39;s decaying docklands were transformed into a hub for tech companies wanting to expand into Europe, and how attracting such firms helped kick-start Ireland&#39;s very own entrepreneurial boom. Tax is top of the agenda as Ireland fights off competition from other countries to be Europe&#39;s answer to Silicon Valley, but could changes on the horizon see government plans to attract more tech players unravel?" />
