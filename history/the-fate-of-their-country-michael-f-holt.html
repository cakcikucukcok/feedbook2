  <title>The Fate of Their Country - Michael F. Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How partisan politics lead to the Civil War &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What brought about the Civil War?  Leading historian Michael F. Holt convincingly offers a disturbingly contemporary answer: partisan politics.  In this brilliant and succinct book, Holt distills a lifetime of scholarship to demonstrate that secession and war did not arise from two irreconcilable economies any more than from moral objections to slavery. Short-sighted politicians were to blame.  Rarely looking beyond the next election, the two dominant political parties used the emotionally charged and largely chimerical issue of slavery&#39;s extension westward to pursue reelection and settle political scores, all the while inexorably dragging the nation towards disunion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the majority opinion (held in both the North and South) that slavery could never flourish in the areas that sparked the most contention from 1845 to 1861-the Mexican Cession, Oregon, and Kansas-politicians in Washington, especially members of Congress, realized the partisan value of the issue and acted on short-term political calculations with minimal regard for sectional comity.  War was the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including select speeches by Lincoln and others, &lt;i&gt;The Fate of Their Country&lt;/i&gt; openly challenges us to rethink a seminal moment in America&#39;s history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
