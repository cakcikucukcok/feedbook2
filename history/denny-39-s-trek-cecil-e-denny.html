  <title>Denny&#39;s Trek - Cecil E. Denny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like many other pioneering North West Mounted Police officers, Cecil Denny was a colourful, independent man with a career full of conquest and controversy. He and his comrades played key roles in the taming of Canada&#39;s wild and woolly west, and in this compilation of selected writings from his books &lt;i&gt;The Law Marches West&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Riders of the Plains&lt;/i&gt;, we get that story straight from the horse&#39;s mouth. Denny relates the fascinating saga of the newly formed police force&#39;s 800-mile trek west in 1874 to deal with outlaw whisky traders, then gives us a first-hand account of the challenges and adventures they experienced bringing law and order to this &quot;great lone land.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Denny&#39;s Trek&lt;/i&gt; features an illuminating new introduction to this observant writer, providing fresh insights into the times and the character of a steadfast man who helped shaped Canada&#39;s West.&lt;/p&gt;" />
