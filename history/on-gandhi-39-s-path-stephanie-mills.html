  <title>On Gandhi&#39;s Path - Stephanie Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bigger has turned out not to be better. Servicing the global economy has exacted a heavy toll in the erosion of our communities and the destruction of our environment. Increasingly, we are coming to realize that the way forward looks a lot like the way back&amp;mdash;back to strong local economies; back to resilient, tight-knit communities; back to the land and work that is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we chart our course through these uncertain times, we are hungry for inspiration. Robert Swann was a self-taught economist, a tireless champion of decentralism, and the father of the relocalization movement. A conscientious war resistor imprisoned for his beliefs, Bob Swann engaged in lifelong nonviolent direct action against war, racism, and economic inequity. His legacy is a vision of a life-affirming, alternative economy of peace founded on innovations in land and monetary reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swann&amp;rsquo;s story is also the untold history of decentralism in the United States. He associated with a constellation of vital, intelligent, independent authors and activists, and ultimately co-founded the Schumacher Society based on the philosophies of &lt;I&gt;Small Is Beautiful&lt;/I&gt; author E. F. Schumacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swann forged tools to build productive, resilient local and regional economies. Now as global industrial civilization flails in the throes of ecological and economic crisis, Swann&amp;rsquo;s working innovations are at the ready to help neighborhoods, local entrepreneurs, and willing communities rebuild at appropriate scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Stephanie Mills&lt;/B&gt; is an author, teacher, practicing bioregionalist, and fellow of the Post-Carbon Institute. She has written numerous books, including &lt;I&gt;Whatever Happened to Ecology?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
