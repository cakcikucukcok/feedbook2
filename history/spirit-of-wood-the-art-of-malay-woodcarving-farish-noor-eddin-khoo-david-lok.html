  <title>Spirit of Wood: The Art of Malay Woodcarving - Farish Noor, Eddin Khoo, David Lok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;With dozens of beautiful photographs and extensive text, this Malaysian art book is a testament to the skill and spirituality of Malaysia&#39;s traditional woodcarvers.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wood has always played a significant role in the Malay world, including the Malay Peninsula, as a means of shelter, livelihood, comfort and convenience.  Among the living arts of Malaysia, woodcarving is one of the oldest, and for centuries woodcarvers enjoyed a prestige that few others did.  A master woodcarver was not simply an artist.  He had a mystical affinity with his material, and through his art he could unlock, channel and enhance the &lt;I&gt;semangat&lt;/I&gt;, or life force, inherent in the wood.  His works ere sought after not only for their beauty, but also for the symbolic power and meaning they embodied, in particular the &lt;I&gt;keris&lt;/I&gt;, considered the pinnacle of woodcarver&#39;s art.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Each of the pieces in this catalog of Malaysian art illustrates a specific motif, use of a pattern or form, or interpretation of a legend.  The woodcarvings range from extremely important and rare pieces, such as royal ceremonial objects, to wood panels, household objects and elements of traditional Malay architecture.&lt;/div&gt;" />
