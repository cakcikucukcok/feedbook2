  <title>Here Shall I Die Ashore - Caleb Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the spring of 1621, Plymouth Colony sent STEPHEN HOPKINS to make the first visit to Wampanoag sachem Massasoit to present a red horsemans coat as a gift and sign of friendship.  For most ordinary Englishmen, venturing off into the depths of unexplored America would have been a once in a lifetime adventure: but not for Stephen.  By the time he turned forty, he had already survived a hurricane, been shipwrecked in the Bermuda Triangle, been written into a Shakespearean play, witnessed the famine and abandonment of Jamestown Colony, and participated in the marriage of Pocahontas.  He was once even sentenced to death!  He got himself and his family onto the Pilgrims Mayflower, and helped found Plymouth Colony.  He signed the Mayflower Compact, lodged the famous Squanto in his house, participated in the legendary Thanksgiving, and helped guide and govern the early colonists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Yet Stephen was just an ordinary man, with a wife, three sons, seven daughters, a small house, some farmland for his corn, and cows named Motley, Sympkins, Curled, and Red.  These are the extraordinary adventures of an ordinary man." />
