  <title>Gold and Freedom: The Political Economy of Reconstruction - Nicolas Barreyre, Arthur Goldhammer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians have long treated Reconstruction primarily as a southern     concern isolated from broader national political developments. Yet at its core, Reconstruction     was a battle for the legacy of the Civil War that would determine the political fate not only of     the South but of the nation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Gold and Freedom,&lt;/i&gt; Nicolas     Barreyre recovers the story of how economic issues became central to American politics after the     war. The idea that a financial debate was as important for Reconstruction as emancipation may     seem remarkable, but the war created economic issues that all Americans, not just southerners,     had to grapple with, including a huge debt, an inconvertible paper currency, high taxation, and     tariffs. Alongside the key issues of race and citizenship, the struggle with the new economic     model and the type of society it created pervaded the entire country. Both were legacies of war.     Both were fought over by the same citizens in a newly reunited nation. It was thus impossible     for such closely related debates to proceed independently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A truly     groundbreaking work, &lt;i&gt;Gold and Freedom&lt;/i&gt; shows how much the fate of     Reconstruction-and the political world it ultimately created-owed to northern sectional     divisions, revealing important links between race and economy, as well as region and nation, not     previously recognized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
