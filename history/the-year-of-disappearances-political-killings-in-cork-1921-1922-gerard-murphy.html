  <title>The Year of Disappearances: Political Killings in Cork 1921-1922 - Gerard Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;&#39;Every spy who was shot in Cork was buried so that nothing was known about them. They just disappeared.&#39; These are the words of an IRA commander recalling the War of Independence in Cork city. The Year of Disappearances examines this claim and others like it. It uncovers a web of suspicion and paranoia that led to scores of men and boys being abducted from their homes before being executed as &#39;enemies of the Republic&#39; and their bodies buried. While some of this took place during the War of Independence, most of it happened the following year, during the so-called &#39;Cork Republic&#39;. The net result was to change the demographic of the south-eastern corner of the city for ever, with hundreds of families fleeing and up to fifty individuals buried in unmarked graves in surrounding areas. Using a wide range of previously untapped sources, Murphy shines new light on one of the darker episodes of twentieth-century Irish history. The Year of Disappearances is a ground-breaking book that deepens our knowledge and understanding of the War of Independence. It subverts many myths, and examines realities long hidden." />
