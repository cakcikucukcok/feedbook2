  <title>A Sendoff For Young Soldiers - Nicola Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While dropping her soldier son off at the airport Stella meets one of his old school friends. He&amp;#39;s also a soldier and about to leave for combat. He is charming and she decides to give him a patriotic sendoff and something to come home for. Two of his buddies are in town and she invites them to join them too, making the lusty fun even wilder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How does a cougar mom follow that?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll be fine, mom,&amp;quot; Bud said. She wrinkled her nose but managed to smile before she looked over at him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, he would say that. He was in the Army now, needing to assert that he was a man, make his mother realize he was all grown up. And he was already bigger than his father&amp;nbsp; over six feet tall and proud of the muscles that he&amp;#39;d developed in boot camp. He&amp;#39;d become a reasonably handsome young man.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She sighed. All the kids he grew up with were adults now. That fact, when it slapped her in the face, still gave Stella a bit of a shock. Kids who had been skinning their knees falling off trikes and playing football yesterday were suddenly going off to other countries&amp;nbsp; some to war zones. Most of Bud&amp;#39;s friends were in the Army too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stopped the car in front of the departure zone. Bud hopped out, eagerly, grabbed his duffle bag, and then kissed her cheek. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll be fine,&amp;quot; he said again. She smiled, then she watched him, walking proud, as he disappeared through the security checkpoint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he was gone, Stella felt an overwhelming loneliness. It had come on when Bud went to boot camp, but she&amp;#39;d known then that it was only for a few weeks. Now he was going off to Iceland, for Pete&amp;#39;s sake&amp;nbsp; for two years. She&amp;#39;d never heard of anyone going there before. It had something to do with cryptography&amp;nbsp; Bud was a technician, in electronics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She shook her head, trying to clear it. The problem was that the lonely feeling lived in the pit of her stomach, not her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With nothing left to see, she got back in her car. She&amp;#39;d go back to the lonely hotel room for the night. She&amp;#39;d driven down for Bud&amp;#39;s graduation from specialty school and to see him off. Tomorrow she&amp;#39;d drive back to the lonely house she shared with his father&amp;nbsp; the big deal guy who couldn&amp;#39;t get away to see his son. Of course, that man, as she thought of him these days, couldn&amp;#39;t get away for anything unrelated to business, especially family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As she walked out of the automatic doors to cross to the parking lot, she saw a familiar face. &amp;quot;Carl Thompson, is that you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The young soldier turned around and gave her a startled smile. &amp;quot;Hello Mrs. Roberts, it sure is. It&amp;#39;s Corporal Thompson now, though.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She smiled at his desire for her to see him as a soldier, a man. Well, he had certainly developed into one. He had the build of a powerful man. He&amp;#39;d been in school with Bud, but he&amp;#39;d grown up even more. In short, he was hot. &amp;quot;I thought you were in the same unit as Bud. I just saw him off to Iceland.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shrugged. &amp;quot;I was, but I flunked out of the specialty school. I never had the academic ability Bud has. But I&amp;#39;m big and do well with physical stuff.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She stared at his body and felt a rush. &lt;i&gt;I just bet you do.&lt;/i&gt; That this young man turned her on was unsettling. He was Bud&amp;#39;s age." />
