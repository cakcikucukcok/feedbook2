      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The best desserts are worth the wait...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pastry chef Jenna Cooper crushed hard on playboy chef Roman Gallagher when her older brother brought him home to share their family Christmas six years ago. Now she&#39;s old enough to do something about it, and she won&#39;t take no for an answer--for anything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Out of the frying pan into the fire...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roman has one hard and fast rule--don&#39;t sleep where you eat. But he can&#39;t say no to Jenna&#39;s plea for him to help her save her family business. Soon she&#39;s working for him, and their scorching chemistry melts Roman&#39;s resistance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you can&#39;t stand the heat...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenna knows Roman has reservations about enjoying the heat between them, but she&#39;s got a plan. She&#39;s going to keep this sexy man so satisfied in--and out--of the kitchen, he won&#39;t regret a thing. But Roman has his own ideas. He wants more than a few hot nights, and he&#39;s going to teach Jenna a lesson about playing with fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Hot Nights series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Into the Fire&lt;br&gt;* Seducing the Playboy&lt;br&gt;* Make Me, Take Me&lt;/p&gt;" />
