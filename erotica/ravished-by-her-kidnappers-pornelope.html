  <title>Ravished By Her Kidnappers - Pornelope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gemini is a homeless teenager trying to survive on the fringes. When all her possessions are stolen, she accepts a meal from three handsome strangers&amp;hellip;and all hell breaks loose. In no time at all, she finds herself in the middle of a sizzling no-holds-barred group orgy. Will she lose more than just her innocence as they pound her repeatedly, hard and unprotected, in every hole?&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~&amp;nbsp; PG Excerpt&amp;nbsp; ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
The rising moon seemed to bob and weave in a curiously seductive rhythm as she chewed, swallowed, chewed some more. Was it only her imagination, or were the flames pulsing with a life all their own, urging her to join in some primal dance?&lt;br /&gt;
Instinctively she swayed in rhythm, then jolted a little when one of the men laid a supportive arm around her shoulders. &amp;ldquo;Easy there, sweetheart. Don&amp;rsquo;t fall into the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; She murmured it a little hazily, but didn&amp;rsquo;t pull away. The heat of his muscular body felt good against hers. Why hadn&amp;rsquo;t she ever realized how wonderful a man&amp;rsquo;s strong hands could feel as they massaged her shoulders in slow, sure strokes? &amp;ldquo;That feels nice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good.&amp;rdquo; Pete leaned a little closer, and murmured in her ear, &amp;ldquo;You want it to feel even better, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She turned her head, and tried to focus on his face. He was so close, she could feel his warm breath tickling her cheek. Part of her&amp;mdash;the sane part that would never accept meals from total strangers&amp;mdash;wanted to pull away and run back to the safety of her little walkway grotto. But his dark eyes held her riveted. They were intense, compelling&amp;hellip;somehow just a little dangerous. A quick thrill of excitement kindled deep in her belly, and began to spread through her tingling body.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You do, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo; he insisted, and his hands tightened on her bare shoulders. &amp;ldquo;You want me to make you feel really good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; It seemed natural to agree, to nod in breathless anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Anything I want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Anything.&amp;rdquo; She moaned a little when his fingers resumed their steady rhythm, kneading and caressing the expanse of her tanned back. &amp;ldquo;Oh, anything!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hear that, boys?&amp;rdquo; Pete glanced beyond her, and smirked at his friends. &amp;ldquo;I told you it would work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Dan grinned back at him. &amp;ldquo;Hot damn! So now what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now we all have some fun.&amp;rdquo; Pete curled his hands around Gemini&amp;rsquo;s and lifted her to her feet. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to do everything we want,&amp;rdquo; he told her. &amp;ldquo;Anything at all. And you&amp;rsquo;re going to love every single bit of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do you know where you are?&amp;rdquo; He led her, step by unsteady step, into the big tent. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re deep in the jungle. Someone kidnapped you, and held you for ransom.&amp;rdquo; He produced a length of rope from his pocket, and dangled it in front of her. &amp;ldquo;We just rescued you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
A vague frown creased her smooth forehead. &amp;ldquo;Kidnapped?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right,&amp;rdquo; he nodded, fixing her with his intense gaze again. &amp;ldquo;You were taken captive, and they were going to ransom you. No one answered their demands, so they were going to rape and kill you instead. We rescued you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You rescued me.&amp;rdquo; She repeated it slowly, trying to piece his words together into a clear picture. Everything seemed so hazy, so jumbled in her whirling mind!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Dan and Ben and I chased them away. You were so glad to see us! Do you remember?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Gradually the confusion on her face cleared, and she began to smile. &amp;ldquo;You rescued me. You saved me from them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right. And you were so relieved, you said you&amp;rsquo;d reward us by doing anything we wanted in return. &lt;i&gt;Anything,&lt;/i&gt; Gemini.&amp;rdquo; His dark eyes bored into hers. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t want money.&amp;nbsp; We want &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt; Ben and Dan and I are your very best friends in the whole world. You&amp;rsquo;re going to do everything we want, and in return we&amp;rsquo;ll make you feel better than you ever dreamed possible!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
A beaming smile curved her lips. &amp;ldquo;All right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good girl.&amp;rdquo; He flashed her a decidedly wicked grin, then nodded for Ben to zip down the entry flap. &amp;ldquo;Tomorrow you won&amp;rsquo;t remember any of this&amp;hellip;but tonight we&amp;rsquo;re going to party &amp;rsquo;til the sun comes up!&amp;rdquo;" />
