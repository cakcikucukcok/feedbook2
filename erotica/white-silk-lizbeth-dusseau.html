  <title>White Silk - Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Traveling alone through Romania, Michelle Monroe is kidnapped from the Orient Express by a band of terrorists. After a harrowing night bound to a metal bed, she is indoctrinated by a brutal mercenary, Colonel Broc. Her life as an independent woman ends in a stunning scene of surrender. She&#39;s stripped, shaved, branded, becoming the sex slave White Silk. Being trained to submit, a tenuous dance with compliance and rebellion follows as she&#39;s taken to a training compound in an unknown Middle Eastern locale where she&#39;s abused, used as a whipping girl and prepared for her sale to a wealthy 21st century slave owner. During her year of training, she becomes the Colonel&#39;s favorite whore, and a strange but uncertain affair of the heart eclipses - if only briefly - her slave status. Silk wonders if she can stir his cold heart, if her fate is truly written. Only when she finds herself on the auction block do the answers to her questions begin to unfold." />
