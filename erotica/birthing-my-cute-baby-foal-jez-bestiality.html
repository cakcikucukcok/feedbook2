  <title>Birthing My Cute Baby Foal - Jez Bestiality</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I caught my leg as I vaulted the wire fence, but I ignored the scratch on my calf and rushed toward the stables. I was on a mission. Nothing was going to stop me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was just before sunrise, and the curtains were still drawn at the bedroom window of the rancher. By my last check I had about an hour to fulfill every filthy sexual fantasy I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was only eighteen, but very experienced. Being one of the most desirable girls in college meant that I had enjoyed my fair share of hot sex. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied. With long blonde hair, a pretty heart-shaped face, and child-bearing hips that were made for birthing, I needed something bigger than the usual jock cock to satisfy my insatiable hunger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I first became interested in the taboo of bestiality when I watched a video that a friend sent me. It was of a dog fucking a girl. At first I was naturally repulsed by it, but something kept me watching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was obvious that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have enjoyed it. And it was obvious that my goofy friend sent it to me for shock value. But the more I tried to pretend that I was disgusted by it, the more it got me off." />
