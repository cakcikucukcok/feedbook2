  <title>On The Edge 8 - Ginny Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In this edition of On The Edge:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(These short stories were originally published in a taboo format as: But Daddy You Know Twins Share Everything, Slut Sister Sally and Bella &amp;amp; Her Brother)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Twins Tease:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Joe is rightfully proud of his twin nineteen year old blondes, but it isn&amp;#39;t until he is asked on a quiet Spanish beach to rub sun lotion on their backs that Joe understands just how devoted to him his girls are, and so begins the sensual seduction of the most important man in their lives. Is their step father tempted, or do their advances spell double trouble?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step Sister Sally:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Redhead Sally didn&amp;#39;t know why her enemy Rachael invited her to her nineteenth birthday party, but her reaction was &amp;quot;who cares why, the booze will be free&amp;quot; but Rachael knew her foe well... a few drinks &amp;amp; Sally always became a slut, &amp;amp; that night didn&amp;#39;t prove to be any different... except Sally wakes up with a hangover &amp;amp; the knowledge that this time, she really fucked the wrong guy!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Bella:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
18 year old Bella can&amp;#39;t sleep, but she isn&amp;#39;t particularly stressed... she doesn&amp;#39;t think anything is heavy on her mind, except, when she does get to sleep she dreams only about sex, &amp;amp; of greater concern, she wakes to a sensation inside that tells her she has been sleepwalking and done more than just dream about it... maybe her step brother Justin knows what she does at night, his grin tells her he may!" />
