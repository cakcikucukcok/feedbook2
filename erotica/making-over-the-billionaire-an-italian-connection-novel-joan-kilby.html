  <title>Making over the Billionaire (an Italian Connection Novel) - Joan Kilby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sexy category romance from Entangled&#39;s Brazen imprint...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never fall for your own deception...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a failed bid to be the first American designer at House of Borhlenghi, Layla Langham is crushed. She&#39;s certain she&#39;s perfect for their company, and she&#39;s risked all her savings to prove it. But Giorgio Borhlenghi&#39;s sisters think Layla&#39;s perfect, too--for the design house &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; their workaholic brother. They convince her they&#39;ll sway their brother into accepting her designs if she&#39;ll get him to stop working for a long weekend--by any means necessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giorgio Borlenghi suspects Layla&#39;s invitation for a relaxing lunch is something his sisters fashioned to lure him away from his desk. But instead of turning the sexy redhead away, he decides to teach all three ladies a lesson and &quot;kidnaps&quot; the beautiful designer to his family&#39;s yacht in Naples to see just how far the ambitious designer wants to take this ruse...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither expected one kiss could lead to enough heat to burn up the sheets for days--nor make them want to give up work and never leave the bedroom again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
