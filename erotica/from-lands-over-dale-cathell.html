  <title>From Lands Over - Dale Cathell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=JUSTIFY&gt;From the great hurricane of 1909 on Assateague Island (a &lt;I&gt;Land Over&lt;/I&gt;), to the death of United States Supreme Court Justice Frank Oden almost a century later on the island of Bimini in the Bahamas, the Oden family copes with survival and death in the sea, and rape, murder and death ashore, as the barrier island family struggles over the years to overcome the poverty of their beginnings. A saga spanning three generations of a family from the beginning of the Twentieth Century to its ending.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=JUSTIFY&gt;A story of the coasters, the people of the mid-Atlantic barrier islands- as they evolve from the days of outlaw gunners and commercial fishermen, to the development of the sport-fishing industry. A story of rich and poor- the guides and captains who had the skills that made it possible and the rich who had the money to pay for it- bound together by the legendary Kelly of the island of Bimini.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=JUSTIFY&gt;The last generation of the Odens persevere as they fight and love, kill and die, from the High Atlas mountains of North Africa and the brothels of Casablanca, to the islands of the mid-Atlantic and the southeast coast of the United States, and finally to the halls of Congress and The Supreme Court.&lt;/P&gt;" />
