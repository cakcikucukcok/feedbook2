The relationship was very abusive and now that she was free to go out there and live her life the best way she saw fit, she couldn&#39;t wait. Her friends were also very happy for her and couldn&#39;t help but make plans for her.  Her ex-boyfriend kept on calling her and tried to make things work one more time. But even though Amina really pitied him, it seemed as though there was no way back. Whatever she had ended was final and nothing could ever make things work out between them ever again.   Will Amina find happiness and tranquility or will she crawl back to her abusive ex-boyfriend? Will her friends come through for her as they had promised? Will this end up well?
