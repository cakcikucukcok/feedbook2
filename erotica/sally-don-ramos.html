      <meta name="description" content="Sally feared the FBI was closing in on her.  There had been an investigation and the FBI had come into her office in San Diego to talk to her.  She had chosen to end it all and swam out to sea, away from the family compound in Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico.
As search helicopters searched and the Coast Guard frantically wound about the area hoping to find her, she, exhausted, realized she wanted to live: however, she couldnt swim any longer.  A small fishing boat came slowly by.  She yelled help, please they heard her.  The Sally from San Diego was no more.  Her epiphany was a stunning revelation.  She would never be the Sally James of old." />
