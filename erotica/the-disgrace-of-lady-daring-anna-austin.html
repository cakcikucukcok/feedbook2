  <title>The Disgrace of Lady Daring - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lady Emily is an innocent. But her dreams are about to be shattered. Her father has gambled away her dowry, and the family is ruined. The only way to avoid the workhouse is through the most sinful and shocking path possible. She must give a year&amp;#39;s service to the Hellfire Club, where London&amp;#39;s most debauched libertines sample the delights of innocent flesh, and always crave fresh meat&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
The woman who walked down the streets of London in her scarlet dress wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the sort people would consider polite company. She had the bearings of a lady, and she dressed like one too. Her dress was fashioned by the most sought after modiste in all of England and her boots were made of the finest leather. If one paid close attention though, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be missed that this was no lady.&lt;br /&gt;
For one, Lady Daring walked the streets with no female chaperone or male family member, despite being only three and twenty and unmarried. Her daytime dress was cut far too low, displaying the creamy mounds of the top of her full breasts, and she wore no bonnet. Instead, her long silky golden hair flowed down her back, almost down to her slim waist, which every woman of London secretly envied. For Lady Daring had a figure that didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be cinched tight with corsets to achieve the small waist and flaring hips that women everywhere wanted.&lt;br /&gt;
Her skirts swished about her legs, and when the light afternoon breeze swept by rustling the material, her bare ankles were a telltale sign of her stocking-less feet. She also wore no gloves, though it was definitely not from a lack of choice. It was no secret that Lady Daring had one of the most extensive wardrobes in all of England; it was said that it would rival the Queen&amp;rsquo;s." />
