  <title>Dirty Trick (A Perfectly Matched Novel) - Christine Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This matchmaker&#39;s about to meet her match...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grace Love is lousy with men. She can spot a match for someone else a mile away, and her balls-on instincts are why her matchmaking business is thriving, but finding her own Prince Charming? The only guy who makes her sixth sense tingle is her playboy best friend, Trick, and no way is she risking their friendship, no matter how hot she knows the sex will be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SWAT officer Trick Mathews is a patient guy, but Grace&#39;s inability to see what&#39;s right in front of her is grinding on his last nerve. Yeah, he blew his shot at breaking out of the friend zone when he tamped down the urge to lick her from head to toe the day they met, but he&#39;s got a plan that&#39;ll change her mind. Incognito at Salem&#39;s hottest Halloween party, he&#39;ll show her &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; how good they could be...and that he&#39;s the man for her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
