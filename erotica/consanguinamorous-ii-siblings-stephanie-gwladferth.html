A tale of forbidden love and taboo relationships. With Linda from A Mother&amp;#39;s Love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I mean I&amp;#39;m sure he was telling himself that he&amp;#39;d come with me so as to protect his little sister from all those evil Europeans, the way our mother saw it. But the way we were together in that first fortnight... I&amp;#39;ve said we were walking around like lovers and I meant it. Anybody seeing us would have assumed we were. It&amp;#39;s not just sex that makes people into lovers, it&amp;#39;s the way they act together, the way they care for each other, the way they look at each other, talk to each other, hundreds of things. And we had all of that...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We had a row, then. And neither of us were honest about the reasons for it. I criticised him for going off philandering with strange women and leaving me alone to worry about him. He pointed out that I wasn&amp;#39;t his mother and what business was it of mine who he slept with? But really, I was upset with him because he&amp;#39;d slept with someone else, not me. I felt betrayed, like he&amp;#39;d been unfaithful to me. For his part, he was refusing to admit that he&amp;#39;d done it to try and get me out of his mind, that he&amp;#39;d gone off and slept with a strange woman to try and deny his feelings for me, which he was ashamed of." />
