  <title>Brenda&#39;s Dirty Revenge - Tia Lascivo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brenda catches her husband with a prostitute. She&amp;#39;s upset, drinks too much wine, and sends a selfie of her bare breasts to her step-son. The photo triggers her dirty revenge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I looked at Mick, forcing myself to confront his stare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Giving it up, I sighed and muttered, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry. Please don&amp;#39;t show anyone--&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I shut up. I knew I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to influence the outcome. Mick was Mick; his father&amp;#39;s son. He would do what he wanted and I couldn&amp;#39;t stop him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Brenda,&amp;quot; Mick said, like he was disappointed in me. In a strange role-reversal, Mick was now the parent, the father saddened by the daughter&amp;#39;s irresponsible actions. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s this?&amp;quot; he asked, holding the phone so I could see the screen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Confronted by my own stupidity, I felt the blush deepen. I had no answers. All I could do was stare at the photo, head swivelling slowly side-to-side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was about to mutter another apology, to beg Mick to delete the image, but, with leaden despair sinking into the pit of my stomach, I saw a figure at the door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh God,&amp;quot; I groaned when Jeff walked in. I gaped at Jeff before looking at Mick. &amp;quot;You showed him?&amp;quot; I breathed." />
