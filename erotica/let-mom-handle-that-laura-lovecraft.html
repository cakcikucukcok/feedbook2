  <title>Let Mom Handle That - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jimmy has a big problem. Make that a big hard problem. In need of some aspirin he accidentally took two of his father&amp;#39;s Viagra! Now he&amp;#39;s hard for no good reason and even masturbating hasn&amp;#39;t caused the &amp;#39;swelling&amp;#39; to go down. In a panic he goes to his mother and asks her what he should do. After appraising the situation, Jimmy&amp;#39;s mom tells him to just lay back, relax, and let Mom handle this!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, then!&amp;rdquo; Mom laughed. &amp;ldquo;Has a mind of its own. Ah, youth.&amp;rdquo; She sighed. &amp;ldquo;Wasted on the young.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom, please.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; she shook her head as if snapping herself out of a daydream. &amp;ldquo;Well, they didn&amp;rsquo;t cover this one in the parent&amp;rsquo;s handbook. But I guess the answer is kind of obvious,&amp;rdquo; Mom shrugged. &amp;ldquo;You have to take care of it. You know,&amp;rdquo; Mom lifted her hand and made a stroking motion.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
On another occasion that would have gotten a better response from him, but if that was her only idea he was screwed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know, what a damn shame.&amp;rdquo; Mom stared at his crotch, a wistful look on her face. &amp;ldquo;What a waste! Too bad you didn&amp;rsquo;t have a pretty young girl to use that up on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom, I already&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Or better yet, a woman my age. Young girls are used to that, but us? One like that is a thing of the past.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom!&amp;rdquo; he snapped. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m your son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know,&amp;rdquo; she shrugged. &amp;ldquo;But you&amp;rsquo;re sitting here with that and as a mom I have to help you out, but as a woman? It&amp;rsquo;s a little distracting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Note to self, when this was all settled he needed to start hanging around his mother more because she was getting more interesting by the minute.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You were saying, Jimmy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I already did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Mom blinked and stared at him. &amp;ldquo;You did?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, it was the first thing I tried I&amp;hellip;you know.&amp;rdquo; He looked away embarrassed. &amp;ldquo;I took care of it and that was almost a half hour ago and it&amp;rsquo;s just as&amp;hellip;uh&amp;hellip;swollen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;hellip;got off and it&amp;rsquo;s still like that,&amp;rdquo; Mom whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mom?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo; Again it seemed as if she&amp;rsquo;d been distracted.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What do I do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh.&amp;rdquo; Mom stared at his bulge for a moment then nodded. &amp;ldquo;You have to get off again. You&amp;rsquo;re really young and you took two. Probably needs more than one time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I started to, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; he rubbed at his temples. &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;m talking about this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s still like that while you&amp;rsquo;re sitting here talking!&amp;rdquo; Mom nodded. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s impressive!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not to me!&amp;rdquo; he whined. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s getting painful!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can imagine!&amp;rdquo; Mom pursed her lips in thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Should I just keep trying?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; Mom shook her head. &amp;ldquo;I think the trouble is since you got off recently it would take a lot to do it again and your hand just isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be good enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then what am I going to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;First thing is you need to relax.&amp;rdquo; Mom put her hand on his arm. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to be fine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go down, then&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll go down, honey.&amp;rdquo; Mom gave him a sly smile. &amp;ldquo;Trust me, Jimmy, your mother knows just what to do.&amp;rdquo;" />
