The Neighbor:  Andrea has heard rumors about her neighbor, but cannot go and ask her because she also has a secret to hide. She seems to be living a rather nice life and does not want to spoil anything but then again her neighbor and friend has other ideas and she ends up loving it.  2. Finding Fun:  In a new country, a royal princess is looking for fun. But no one ever told her that she would find it during the first day and never before had she thought that she could have so much fun away from her palace where she has lived all her life.  3. Twenty One Finally:  Twenty one years ago, Janet did not exist, but now she does and she is more that excited to get to twenty one. She knows that life really starts at twenty one and with friends like the ones she has, she has to play by their rules, but then again she too can change the rules of the game.   Only for Adults (18+)" />
