  <title>A Mother’s Bond - Celena Wyndemere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
This young mother needed a love that she didn&#39;t know existed. Finally finding it, all morals and scruples are cast aside in a moment of madness-a chance to grab pleasure before it is taken away. What can come of love from a taboo source? For the Mother in this story, the opportunity is one many would consider perverse and deranged, for it is incest. But the forbidden provides a release and a need.
EXCERPT
Shawn tried not to stare. His mother noticed that her grown son looked a little uncomfortable. “Sorry Mom”. said Shawn “I&#39;m not used to seeing your, umm...”
“My breasts? They&#39;re called breasts Shawn.” She was giggling by this time. “I really don&#39;t mind you seeing them. In fact, it&#39;s kind of freeing. Your Dad hated when I breastfed Tommy.”
“I&#39;m fine with you watching me feed your brother. I think it&#39;s actually kind of special for me. You know I breastfed you too Shawn. Although, that&#39;s been a while ago.” She finally covered them.
Then she said, “I&#39;m really sorry that your fiancé and your Dad hurt you so much today. Would you like to lie down? Maybe some time alone would help.”
Shawn replied, “I would like to lie down, and I know that I&#39;m a grown man. But would you lie down with me? I know it might be asking too much, but I don&#39;t want to be alone.”
“Shawn, it&#39;s perfectly fine. I understand. Right now all I want is for you to feel loved. So come on baby, let&#39;s go have that quiet time together.”
And so she took her son into her big, comfortable bedroom which had a beautiful king size canopy bed. It was a quiet, peaceful sanctuary.
“You don&#39;t want to wrinkle that nice shirt, so take it off, and I&#39;ve seen you in your underwear, so off with the pants too. I want you to be comfortable so you can relax and rest. I&#39;m going to change into a long T shirt.”
“If you insist Mom”, said Shawn. Are you sure you&#39;re okay with this?” I know it&#39;s asking a lot...” His mother shushed him by saying, “Just get undressed and get in bed Shawn. Everything is fine.”
Shawn waited until his mom closed her bathroom door before he got undressed. When he finished, he turned down the bed and slipped between the sheets.
When she came out, Shawn tried not to stare. After all, she was his mother. She was wearing a T shirt alright. A very sexy one. It was low cut, showing her ample cleavage.
