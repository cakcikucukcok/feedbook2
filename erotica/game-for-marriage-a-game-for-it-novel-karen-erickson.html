  <title>Game for Marriage (A Game for It Novel) - Karen Erickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Struggling artist Sheridan Harper never imagined she&#39;d spend a sizzling night with Jared Quinn, the smoking-hot star quarterback of her local professional football team, the San Jose Hawks. And she&#39;s even more shocked when Jared&#39;s publicist offers her a proposition: a fake marriage to keep Jared out of the gossip mags. Being that close to Jared would be too tempting, so to protect her heart, she insists on secretly including a clause forbidding sex between them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared just wants to keep his starting QB job and keep it in San Jose. His reputation as a ladies&#39; man has landed him in the headlines one too many times, but there&#39;s something about his kind, passionate new wife that tempts him beyond reason. Any sort of intimacy between them is completely forbidden, but as their bodies fall in deep, will their hearts follow suit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Game for It series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Game for Marriage&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Game for Trouble &lt;br&gt;Book #3 Game For Tonight&lt;/p&gt;" />
