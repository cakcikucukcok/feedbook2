      <meta name="description" content="&#39;D&#39;, a Sadistic and Cunning Mistress, believes James may become her ultimate submissive. After a few dates with &#39;straight&#39; intercourse, she progressively introduces James to sexual servitude, training him by way of increasingly decadent encounters where he learns that her pleasure is paramount, and his is insignificant.

Chris Bellows is a master in his depiction of the ultimate male submission to the Superior, Dominant Female. Note: &quot;A Gift From James&quot; is not for the squeamish or those looking for an introductory Femdom novel, but for those readers ready to take a leap into extreme Femdom fantasy." />
