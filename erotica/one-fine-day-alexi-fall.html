  <title>One Fine Day - Alexi Fall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Married life is slowly losing its appeal for Patrick, an office worker and budding novelist. His wife Jenna is a nagging, puritanical pain who belittles him like it&amp;rsquo;s going out of fashion. Even on his day off, a day for relaxing alone and working on his novel, he can&amp;rsquo;t escape her sharp tongue. But much to his surprise, he isn&amp;rsquo;t the only one with the day off: pretty Teagan is going to spend the day with him!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hey Pat, wake up!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick soon returned to the land of reality and groaned, rubbing his sleepy eyes. &amp;ldquo;Morning, Teagan. Can you get off me, please?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nope!&amp;rdquo; his wife&amp;rsquo;s daughter giggled and bounced. &amp;ldquo;Geez, it took you forever to wake up! You&amp;rsquo;re such a sleepyhead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The girl was sitting on top of him, the blankets and sheets wrapped around her. The bedsprings squealed as she bounced some more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick snatched a glance at the bedside clock and rubbed his eyes. Seven twenty-five. His teenage stepdaughter looked down at him with that big, toothy smile. Her hair was a blonde mess, and the more she bounced the more she had to blow it off her face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hey, come on. Get off me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mm-mm!&amp;rdquo; she shook her head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you have school?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nope! Free day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There went his plans for a quiet, lonesome day working on his novel. &amp;ldquo;Is your mother around?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She nodded, still bouncing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then get off, hon. I should say goodbye to her before she leaves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nuh-uh!&amp;rdquo; She bounced harder, causing her firm, braless boobs to jiggle under her baggy My Little Pony shirt." />
