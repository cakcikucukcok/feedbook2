  <title>Forbidden Romance: - Nikki Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First Story: Blacker the Berry
Heather Drake, millionaire orange magnate, Thornton Drakes only child, was coming home finally after being sent away for six years to boarding school. She was not only just a little peeved at her dad for that, but a lot, and she was determined to make him pay by messing around with the hired help. It only took Heather about five minutes back at her home, Drakehaven, before she met the hired hand that would rock her world and prove without a shadow of doubt that the old saying she had once heard, The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice, was fact!
Second Story: Doing Big Dan
Motherhood is a beautiful thing! Susan Conner would be the first to agree with that statement, even when her newlywed nineteen-year-old husband, Danny, left her and their barely a month old baby girl to join the navy. Susans uncertain future was saved when her in-laws took her and her baby in to await Dannys return. However, Susan didnt realize until it was too late all the things she would have to do on the farm to help out, including doing Big Dan!
Third Story: Fill Mommy
Jamie Lee Lockwood was a happily married newlywed, until she met her nineteen-year-old stepson, Cole. Everything about him spelled trouble, from his sensual manly beauty to his total disregard of her marriage to his dad. Jamie soon became his willing victim. He was a rich kid who was filled with anger, that is, until he filled his stepmommy." />
