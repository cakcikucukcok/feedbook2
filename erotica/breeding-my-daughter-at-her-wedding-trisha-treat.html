  <title>Breeding My Daughter at Her Wedding - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I had been fucking my daughter, Bella, since she was 18, but I had always made sure not to get her pregnant. Today she was getting married to some asshole and I would lose her forever. As her Daddy who taught her everything she knows about how to please a man, I was her first for everything. I was not about to give her away without being the first to put a baby in her.&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I need you one last time, Bella,&amp;quot; I said sternly. &amp;quot;I know we had an agreement, but you&amp;#39;re not married yet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Bella blushed and looked away. &amp;quot;But, Daddy,&amp;quot; she started. &amp;quot;I am going to miss you too, but we shouldn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&amp;#39; She fiddled with the tie on the front of her dress. How I wanted to take it between my teeth and pull it loose, to watch her tits fall out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t stand the thought of that asshole putting your first baby in you,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got to try first. Right now. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, fine. I&amp;#39;ll have to accept that. But I&amp;#39;m at least going to try.&amp;quot;" />
