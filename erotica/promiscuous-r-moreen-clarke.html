  <title>Promiscuous - R. Moreen Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Every woman has a wild side.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Shy, sweet and reserved, Connie Jefferson is the classic good girl. Her boyfriend, Victor, is attentive and romantic, but she can&#39;t forget one afternoon of mind-blowing ecstasy she shared with another man.  .  .a wild, carnal encounter that left her primed and aching for more.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deandra Morgan has an insatiable appetite for the finer things in life--big cars, lavish houses, and sex. Lots of sex. As a wild teen, Deandra was shunned by Connie&#39;s straitlaced friends. Now Dee has set her sights on Marshall James, a wealthy real estate developer, and she&#39;ll do anything, anywhere, to keep him satisfied--and far away from Connie.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tall, muscular, and sexually gifted, Marshall is drawn to Deandra&#39;s voluptuous figure and uninhibited nature, until she starts to get a little too freaky. He knows the explosive sensuality that Connie keeps hidden, and meeting her again months after their scorching romp makes him wonder if he&#39;s with the wrong woman. But Deandra won&#39;t be giving up that easily. The battle is on--and sex will be the ultimate weapon.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;R.
