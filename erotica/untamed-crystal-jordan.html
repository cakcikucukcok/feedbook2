      <meta name="description" content="The biological warfare of the twenty-first century changed the planet in astonishing ways, transforming humans into shape-shifters who love to walk on the wild side--reveling in danger and the explosive desire that consumes them.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desire For A Price&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half-human, half-lynx, Delilah Chase makes her living as a professional thief. But when half-human, half-hawk Hunter Avery catches her trying to steal his priceless ruby, he makes her a proposition: spend a week in his bed, or take a trip to jail. What follows is seven days of unrelenting, primitive passion neither can live without.  .  .   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desire With No Limits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the owner of Tail, the most notorious techno brothel in New Chicago, mink-shifter Lorelei Chase specializes in fulfilling all of her clients&#39; kinky fantasies. She just has one rule: Never sample the goods that her customers or workers offer. But every day, jaguar-shifter Nolan Angelo tempts her to break that rule--until she ultimately gives in to a burning lust that knows no control.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;There are books you read and those very special ones you devour.  .  .Carnal Desires is definitely one of the latter. This is definitely an author to watch.&quot;  --Kate Douglas, author of &lt;i&gt;Wolf Tales&lt;/i&gt;" />
