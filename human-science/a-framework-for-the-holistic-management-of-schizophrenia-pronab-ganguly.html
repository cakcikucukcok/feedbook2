  <title>A Framework for the Holistic Management of Schizophrenia - Pronab Ganguly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The schizophrenia sufferer leads a very poor quality of life. They suffer from the following:
Hallucination and delusions (this is addressed by clinical intervention and counseling)
Homelessness
Financial constraints
Unemployment
Lack of secured accommodation
Independent living skill
Lack of education
Lack of entertainment
Poor relationship
Lack of friendship
Lack of insurance needs
Lack of public trustee and guardianship needs
Stigma
Social isolation
Insurance needs
Lack of entertainment
Hence, to improve the quality of the schizophrenia sufferer, a holistic approach of management is needed. The definition of holistic is relating to the idea that things should be studied as a whole and not just as a sum of their parts. Thus, in schizophrenia, a holistic framework of management is of paramount importance. This book describes such a framework for holistic management of schizophrenia and evaluates it in Australian context.  A ten-year long case study has been undertaken by implementing this framework with a real-life schizophrenia sufferer. The outcome is spectacular and long lasting. The sufferer is now near normal and leads an almost normal quality of life. Additionally a web-based computerized survey has been undertaken by the experts in the field to evaluate this framework. The results are very encouraging." />
