  <title>The Truth About Sex, A Sex Primer for the 21st Century Volume II: Sex for Grown-Ups - Gloria G. Brame</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Readers say Dr. Gloria Brame has changed their lives. Find out why in SEX FOR GROWN-UPS. The ultimate sex-positive adult primer, SEX FOR GROWN-UPS, takes a delightfully original and upbeat approach to sex based on three simple rules--that human sexual behavior is complicated, that sex and gender diversity are normal, and that all adults can have pleasurable sex. In a radical departure from institutionalized theories about what sex should be, Brame explains the facts about what sex actually is, and shows you how to use this information to improve your sex life and relationships. Drawing on sex history, scientific data, sex studies, medical studies, and stories from her private practice, SEX FOR GROWN-UPS gives you sex education you never knew you needed and will always be grateful you received.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;GLORIA G. BRAME, Ph.D. in Human Sexuality, is an author, blogger, sex historian, board-certified sexologist, and sex therapist in private practice. Brame is the world&#39;s leading authority on fetishes and BDSM, and is a much-quoted expert on mainstream sexual issues, including performance disorders and orgasmic function. In addition to &lt;i&gt;The Truth About Sex, Volume I: Sex and the Self&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Volume II: Sex for Grown-Ups&lt;/i&gt;, she is the author of perennial bestsellers &lt;i&gt;Different Loving: The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Come Hither: A Commonsense Guide to Kinky Sex&lt;/i&gt;. A full professor of Human Sexuality at the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, Brame also sits on the board of the Woodhull Sexual Freedom Alliance. Most recently, Brame was named among the &quot;10 Best Sex and Dating Experts,&quot; by DatingAdvice.com. Google Gloria Brame or follow @DrGloriaBrame on Twitter." />
