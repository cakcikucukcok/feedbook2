  <title>Healing Homosexuality: Case Stories of Reparative Therapy - Joseph Nicolosi, Lucy Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1973, when all the arguments were presented to the American Psychiatric Association both for and against the idea of homosexuality as pathology, it was the personal disclosures of gay men that had the most influence. Listening to their stories of frustration in treatment-and their newfound happiness through acceptance of a gay identity-the American Psychiatric Association voted to omit homosexuality as a diagnostic category. Now, twenty years later, Dr. Joseph Nicolosi presents the opposite kind of personal testimony. This testimony is from homosexual men who have tried to accept a gay identity but were dissatisfied, and then benefitted from psychotherapy to help free them of homosexuality. Some readers of this book may be surprised by the directive style of Dr. Nicolosi&#39;s therapeutic intervention. In part, this is due to the editorial synthesis of the transcript. More importantly, however, reparative therapy does require a more involved therapist-a benevolent provocateur who departs from the tradition of uninvolved, opaque analyst to become a salient male presence. The therapist must balance active challenge with warm encouragement to follow the father-son model. This is an essential principle of reparative therapy. &lt;i&gt;A Jason Aronson Book&lt;/i&gt;" />
