  <title>Existence, as I Understand It - Kenneth V. Garbett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In my youth I began to feel that there was something odd about existence,
that I just couldnt seem to clearly identify. As I continued to ponder and
tried to rationalize my perspective of our physical reality, I struggled to
fi nd a way to even begin to explain what I felt, what I knew to be truth, that
there is so much more to our existence than what we can actually perceive, all
around us, that science is just as important as spirituality, and that fact truly
is often stranger than fi ction. The information contained in this book, I feel,
is important to all human kind. It is the closest I have come to expressing
what I feel to be truth, in terms of science and reason. May we all learn to see
reality for what it truly is, and not just what we see on the surface." />
