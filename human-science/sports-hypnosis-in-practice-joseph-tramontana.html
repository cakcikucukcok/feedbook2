  <title>Sports Hypnosis in Practice - Joseph Tramontana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This book offers new strategies and scripts for hypnotherapists, sports counsellors and sports psychologists working with athletes to help them achieve their peak performance. A major focus of the book is that the therapist does not necessarily need to be familiar with the sport or activity to serve as a &amp;#147;mental coach&amp;#8221; to the athlete. The athlete is instructed that the goal is not to improve the mechanics of their performance (that is left up to their coaches) but, rather, to help them to relax, concentrate and focus so that they fulfill their maximum potential. They learn not to let the mental side of their game trip up the physical side, but rather to enhance it.&lt;/div&gt;" />
