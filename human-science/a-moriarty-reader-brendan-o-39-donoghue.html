  <title>A Moriarty Reader - Brendan O&#39;Donoghue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Moriarty (1938–2007), the Kerry-born poet, mystic and philosopher, has been hailed as one of the most original thinkers to have emerged from Ireland in recent decades. Opening a way into John Moriarty&#39;s complex work through Guo Xi&#39;s painting Early Spring&#39;, this Reader reveals the extraordinary nature of his thought. It draws on key passages from Moriarty&#39;s first publication, Dreamtime (1994/2011), and progresses through his subsequent landmark books, the Turtle trilogy (1996–98), Nostos (2001) and What the Curlew Said (2007), weaving together the most seminal passages from each. A Moriarty Reader serves as an excellent introductory text for those unfamiliar with his writings and illuminates unacknowledged aspects of his thinking for those already familiar with his work. The Reader highlights Moriarty&#39;s deft ability to challenge and bring into question habitual modes of Western thought and perception; his willingness and courage to act as a cultural shaman for Western humanity; his innovative philomythical and metanoetic search for wisdom and truth, and his astonishingly original interpretation of scripture. Bearing witness to his genius, this book reveals Moriarty to be one of Ireland&#39;s and Europe&#39;s most significant writers, an image-thinker of the highest rank, who warrants serious attention. A Moriarty Reader encompasses a broad spectrum of historical cultures, but its focus on Moby-Dick (Pequod Culture) and Native American stories in particular will profoundly resonate with an international audience. Cohering around the Daoist-inspired painting of the title, this work sets the tone for Moriarty&#39;s panethnic adventure in philosophy, myth and religion. A foreword by Irish hospice movement founder Dr Michael Kearney, and a glossary, name and subject index provide interpretive apparatus to aspects of the work." />
