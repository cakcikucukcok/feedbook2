  <title>Healthy Anger: How to Help Children and Teens Manage Their Anger - Bernard Golden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How should we respond to a childs temper tantrum? To a teenagers sullen resentment? How can we help children and teens experience their anger without being overwhelmed by it? How can we deal with their anger before it leads to depression, isolation, or even violence?   In Healthy Anger, Bernard Golden draws upon more than twenty years of experience as a psychologist and teacher to offer specific, practical strategies for helping children and teens manage their anger constructively. Golden has developed a set of skills that parents, teachers, and counselors can use to show children how to identify the causes of anger; how to respond to it in ways that lead to an internal sense of competence and self-control; how to use anger to understand their own emotional situation; and how to develop a greater capacity for empathy towards themselves and others. And he shows parents how to cope with outbursts--including clear, step-by-step instructions and problem-solving skills--how to derail escalating anger, reward good behaviors, and recognize when professional help is needed. For anyone who has ever helplessly confronted a childs rage or a teenagers defiant fury, Healthy Anger offers a wealth of wise insight, clear advice, and eminently practical strategies for turning anger into understanding." />
