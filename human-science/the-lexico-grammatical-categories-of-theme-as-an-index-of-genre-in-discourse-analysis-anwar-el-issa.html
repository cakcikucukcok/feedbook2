  <title>The Lexico-Grammatical Categories of Theme as an Index of Genre in Discourse Analysis - Anwar El-Issa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is based on systemic-functional grammar (SFG) and focuses on the concept of Theme (the element which occupies the initial position in the clause in English), which plays a special role in the textual organization of the message contained in the clause. Theme represents one of the ways by which writers construct meaningful communicative language or stretches of discourse. It signals the relationship between the thought in the speakers mind and its expression in the discourse. Therefore, it contributes to the method of development of the texts proper. 
The reason for choosing Theme as a tool of analysis stems from the fact that it is a fruitful approach to the understanding of texts as is shown by the fact that it has been the concern of a number of major studies. I will adopt both a qualitative and a quantitative analysis. The results of this analysis will be presented and tabulated in such a way as to underline the distinguishing features of the genre. The tools of functional grammar (Theme and Transitivity) will be applied to the data being collected. 
A significant, positive facet pertinent to this study lies in its pedagogical implications. The study of the structure of Theme has resulted in useful applications, and the findings drawn from the data collected will, it is hoped, have wider application; they are not meant to be merely suggestive. The findings in  this book show how Theme-Rheme can have significant pedagogical values and impacts on the native and non-native learners. The learner not only has to construct his/her sentences, choosing appropriate lexis, but he/she has to make those sentences cohere into a text belonging to the genre being tackled. The findings in this book also suggest that control of the Theme-Rheme system is part of what the successful writer (native or non-native) uses to achieve such coherence. In this regard, students can be aware of a variety of linguistics choices to help them write more effectively and coherently." />
