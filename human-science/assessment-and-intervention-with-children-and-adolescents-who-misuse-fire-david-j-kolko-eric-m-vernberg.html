  <title>Assessment and Intervention with Children and Adolescents Who Misuse Fire - David J. Kolko, Eric M. Vernberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s surprisingly common for children and adolescents to play with fire and to actually set fires. A single fire has the potential to cause a cascade of serious consequences to children, families, and their community, sometimes with devastating impact. Yet, there is limited practical information and evidence-based advice available to help programs and practitioners with children and adolescents who engage in this behavior.
&lt;em&gt;Assessment and Intervention with Children and Adolescents Who Misuse Fire&lt;/em&gt; presents practical guidelines to facilitate the clinical assessment and treatment of youth firesetting. Based on nearly four decades of research and intervention experience, the treatment is directed toward reducing any inappropriate involvement in fire or related activities in order to lower the risk for property damage, personal injury, and other adverse consequences associated with these behaviors. This evidence-based intervention provides clinicians with a comprehensive program for school-aged children, early adolescents, and adolescents, and the child and his/her caregiver(s) are both important participants in treatment. The modular approach allows for therapists to be flexible in deciding which topics to cover in order to best meet the needs of children and families. This treatment model encourages more appropriate and safe behaviors in both children/adolescents and their caregivers and provides skills likely to discourage fire involvement.  In addition, the materials promote controlling exposure to incendiary materials and opportunities to use fire.  The intervention is provided in a single volume, encompassing a practitioner guide, parent workbook, and child/adolescent workbook, including handouts for participating clients." />
