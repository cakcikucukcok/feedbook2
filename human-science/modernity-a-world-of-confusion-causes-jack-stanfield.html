  <title>Modernity, a World of Confusion:Causes - Jack Stanfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered why society is getting cruder and ruder, with stress, depression and mental illness rising and little joy felt? Why children behave badly and schools are failing? Why trust has vanished with your identity? And why sex is oozing out of every aspect of the culture? We live in a skeptical age with the country splintering into special interest groups claiming to be victims and requiring special treatment, and a Congress thats deadlocked in partisan bickering. There is anger and tension and really intolerable things being tolerated, placing women and children in danger. 
	If you have such questions, this is your book, an inquiry into the spirit of the age. Examined are root causes for the darkened culture, immoral behavior, and rejection of traditions. The age glorifies science and technical progress, and yet is unhappy and sickly. Individualism surmounts community concerns creating narcissistic people tending toward nihilism, where the self is the center of the universe. The postmodern culture throws away things, relationships, and lives, like it disposes of outdated items. Logic is replaced with how I feel, and reliance on personal experience for making decisions. Relativism is accepted in ethics and for determining truth, so that it is my truth and your truth, and objectivity and common sense are lost. Science is erecting the abstract man, who, in the process, has lost heart and a sense of reality, living in a delusional world. The result is a profusion of confusion." />
