A founding text in the development of positivism and the discipline of sociology, the work provides a revised and full account of the theory Comte presented earlier in his multi-part The Course in Positive Philosophy (1830–1842).<br /><b><i>A General View of Positivism - Wikipedia</i></b> | Comte's reverence for Catholicism is all through "A General View of Positivism" although in trying to sell his philosophy to Frenchmen he made the church sound better than it actually was. Puzzling is his attribution of the idea of separating the temporal power (government) from the spiritual power (philosophic) to the Roman Church.<br /><b><i>A General View of Positivism: Comte, Auguste ...</i></b> | Isidore Auguste Marie François Xavier Comte, better known as Auguste Comte, was a philosopher, founder of the discipline of sociology, and of the doctrine of positivism. He is sometimes regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>A General View of Positivism - Auguste Comte</a> </h3></p><hr/>
