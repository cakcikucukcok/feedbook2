  <title>Inside-Out - Smanu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a speck of fire from mans inherent quest to be at a perfect self-contented oneness with nature. Todays rat race towards technological development might have thrusted man to lack awareness of that quest. Infact, the human journey and conditioning itself has an inherent character of making him lack awareness of his pristine aspects. This book is a humble effort in reminding man of his own quest, in facilitating him to get in touch with the truth long-suppressed and forgotten.
The growing imbalance in the society is finding its expression not merely as the materialistic gap between haves and have-nots, but also in the form of Kundalini/Consciousness Awakening in more and more people. The spiritual deficit of the human collective is manifesting as spiritual burden on some. We know the many scientific laws of conservation, dont we? Among other things, the book propounds a possibility that our incapacity to comprehend God might be the limitiation of human evolution, as of now!
As much as the book talks about God, Spirituality and Mysticism, the book is more an effort in questioning the sufficiency of science for current needs of human evolution. Time has come for man to expand his horizons not through Technology but by regaining his roots of spiritual strength and in the process expand the horizons of science. No development can be linear and no one instrument can prove self-sufficient for human evolution. In that sense, Science has reached its threshold. Yet, Science with Heart is waiting to be discovered and explored through the reinstatement of Trinity and Balance in the world.
This book might not contain any new spiritual talk or wisdom for the spiritually inclined. But it might make a very interesting read for those who are not spiritually inclinedyet. And when we realize that the term spiritually inclined is a misnomer, for we are the spirit, the purpose behind this book would have been fulfilled." />
