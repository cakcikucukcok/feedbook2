  <title>Revolution in Mind: Freud, The Freudians, and the Making of - George Makari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A masterful history of one of the most important movements of our time, &lt;em&gt;Revolution in Mind&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant, engaging, and radically new work&amp;#8212;the first ever to fully account for the making of psychoanalysis. In a sweeping narrative, George Makari demonstrates how a new way of thinking about inner life coalesced and won followers who spread this body of thought throughout the West. Along the way he introduces the reader to a fascinating array of characters, many of whom have been long ignored or forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid great ferment, Sigmund Freud emerged as a creative, interdisciplinary thinker who devised a riveting new theory of the mind that attracted acolytes from the very fields the Viennese doctor had mined for his synthesis. These allies included Eugen Bleuler, Carl Jung, and Alfred Adler, all of whom eventually broke away and accused the Freudian community of being unscientific. Makari reveals how in the wake of these crises, innovators like S&amp;#225;ndor Ferenczi, Wilhelm Reich, Melanie Klein, and others reformed psychoanalysis, which began to gain wide acceptance only to be banished from the continent and sent into exile due to the rise of fascism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groundbreaking, insightful, and compulsively readable, &lt;em&gt;Revolution in Mind&lt;/em&gt; goes beyond myth and polemic to give us the story of one of the most controversial intellectual endeavors of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
