  <title>Journey to Aztlantica - Richard S. Flores</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE JOURNEY TO ATLANTICA
Aztlantica is the spiritual homeland of the Meso-America Quetzalcatl Prophecy. The Journey attempts to bring forth new insights, hidden history, and a future in peril. The Journey to Aztlantica is a call for awakening and the need to transition from an old degenrating world to the promise of a sustainable a new world that will be able to survive the perials of the future  .
The Journey expresses concern about the degenerating trajectory of capitalistic economic and political systems. About their questionable influence on the future stabilities of world societies and governments.
The old-world economic worldview has reached it&#39;s limitation. It is on the path of  regression and is condusive to social dis-integration. This book alludes to the need for individuals to prepare themselves to confront and survive the calamities of climatic change and man-made calamities of the future. The Journey calls for human evolution. For the building of an alternative economic system as a way to change the human character and behavior. A system that would support the principles of natural human evolution, a more equalitarian society and would support the development of a humanitarian worldview.  The Journey proposes the establishment of new social, cultural, educational and spiritual models. It calls for establishing a philosophical model based on a respectful and balanced relationship with the natural environment and within the human community. The Journey proposes a new spiritual movement for the new world, an organized religion that would be compatible with the new worldview of Aztlantica. The old religions are an integral part of a degenerating old world.  Aztlantica calls for the refinement and rejuvenation of human cultures in order to promote respect, peace, balance, and harmony around the world. The Journey stresses the need to crossover to a new worldview reality, the circular worldview. In order for humanity to survive adequately in a perialous future and in order to create a sustainable world in which the human community can live, prosper and advance: individuals must first transform themselves before they can transform into the future." />
