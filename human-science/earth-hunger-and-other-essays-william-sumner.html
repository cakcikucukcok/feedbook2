  <title>Earth-Hunger and Other Essays - William Sumner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Now it has seemed to me, in my own experience with Sumner, and in my teaching, that such an attitude toward the questions of societal life is, for the young at least, the one best adapted to open&amp;mdash;wrench open, if you will&amp;mdash;the gates of the mind and introduce the impulse to independent thinking. I do not mean at all that this result is to be attained by an unresisting acceptance of the forcefully expressed opinions of a compelling reasoner; in fact, I&amp;nbsp;believe that, in the case of Sumner, many a man has been goaded to think things out for himself for very rage at the conclusive manner in which Sumner used to dispose of some of his pet or traditional notions. Sometimes such a man came to agree with Sumner; again he believed that he had won the right not to assent&amp;mdash;but in either case there had come to him an awakening in the matter of his own mental powers and life. This is why so many men who have eventually come to dissent from Sumner&amp;#39;s positions, yet look back upon him as an intellectual awakener. The difficult thing about getting a vision in the large is in the attainment of an elevated plane of thought; if someone can lift you to it, you will find room enough there to range away from the exact spot upon which you were originally set down. It is the &amp;quot;lift&amp;quot; which is crucial&amp;mdash;and that it is which only the strong and positive man, who has wrought himself up beyond the pull of the trivial and traditional, can give.&amp;quot; - A.G.
