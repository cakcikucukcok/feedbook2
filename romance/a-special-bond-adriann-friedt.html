  <title>A Special Bond - Adriann Friedt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;With his entire life in limbo, Owen Lane travels the country searching for a place to drop anchor, a job to interest him, and, most of all, his peace of mind. Fifteen years of working as a special foreign agent for government intelligence have left him bitter and lonely. He has recently quit his job with the Agency after an explosion killed his partner.&lt;P&gt;	While driving through northern Ohio, Owen stops at Hart &amp; Mather bed and breakfast in the picturesque village of Sharon Center. He returns there three days later, lured by the peaceful location, the comfortable inn, and especially the gracious innkeeper, Heidi Bond. Thirty-four-year-old Heidi inherited the inn from her aunt and uncle and resigned from teaching to run it.&lt;P&gt;	Owen extends his stay at the 1840s inn to help out when the business manager requires emergency surgery. His soul and heart have found, at last, some calm and respite in the ambiance of the village and the inn. &lt;P&gt;	For deep-seated reasons Owen and Heidi mask their interest in each other at first. Circumstances lead them into an embrace which surprises them and intensifies their attraction. Owen, however, wants no entanglement because he knows that he will leave soon, and Heidi still harbors betrayal and deep hurt from a cruel fianc. &lt;P&gt;	The nightly goings and comings of two guests, Ivan and June Leathers, lead Heidi and Owen beyond curiosity. The two guests create a ribbon of suspense and possible skullduggery.&lt;/P&gt;" />
