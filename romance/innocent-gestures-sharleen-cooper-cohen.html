  <title>Innocent Gestures - Sharleen Cooper Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
One glorious summer on the banks of the Loire, James Barton fell irrevocably in love with Catherine D&#39;Aumant.  But their love affair was not to last.  The Duke D&#39;Aumant did not consider an American idealist a suitable match for his daughter. 
&lt;P&gt;
Nineteen years later, despite a reasonably happy marriage and a successfully career with the FBI, memories of Catherine and their all-consuming passion continue to plague James and he is haunted by a desire to return to France.
&lt;P&gt;
Then James is summoned to France to help solve a series of the most bizarre murders in national history. There he encounters Paul D-Aumant - Catherine&#39;s
 manipulative brother and the current duke - and is disturbed by a beguiling young girl whose sensual behaviour arouses sexual desires beyond his control.  James also discovers that Catherine is no longer the woman he remembers...
&lt;P&gt;
Struggling to come to terms with this, James tracks a heinous killer and pieces together the events of the last nineteen years to reveal an intricate pattern of forbidden passion, sexual obsession and revenge." />
