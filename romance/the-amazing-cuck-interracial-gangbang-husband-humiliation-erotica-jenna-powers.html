  <title>The Amazing Cuck (Interracial Gangbang Husband Humiliation Erotica) - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Melissa and Adam are newlyweds in a contest to beat other teams around the world to win two million dollars as part of a new television series. They luckily enter into the final three. While the current first place holders are physically capable, Melissa and Adam know that they are extremely weak in mental tasks. The team that&#39;s only sixteen minutes ahead of them, two basketball players, however, are very capable and a team to be careful of.
Adam devises a plan to not only try to tire out the basketball players before the next round in the contest begins but also fulfill a fantasy of his. He wants Melissa to seduce and tire out the two black men. Melissa is stunned when she hears of her husband&#39;s plan and furious that he even thought of such a thing. However, as she thinks about it, she feels that it&#39;s something she can do.
Melissa has rarely found that a man could last more than ten minutes with her. With two black men, she thinks it&#39;ll take, at most, twenty minutes of her time, but has a potential reward of two million dollars. She decides to follow Adam&#39;s plan and seduce the two big black basketball players. When the newlyweds find the basketball players, they celebrate and the plan goes underway. Melissa has only been with white men and will that inexperience cause the newlyweds&#39; plans to backfire when she starts seducing the two big, powerful black men?" />
