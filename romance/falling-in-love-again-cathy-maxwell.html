  <title>Falling in Love Again - Cathy Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highborn country heiress Mallory Edwards was dutifully fulfilling family obligations when she exchanged marriage vows with a dashing gentleman she barely knew. But the charming beast abandoned her on their wedding night. Years later&amp;#8212;facing prison because of her husband&#39;s debts&amp;#8212;she has finally found the blackguard, John Barron, again. And she&#39;s not leaving until the faithless rogue grants her a divorce!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John is enchanted by this delightful hellion who causes a scene at his London soir&amp;#233;e. Could this be the forgotten rural miss whom his father once forced him to wed? Now that Mallory&#39;s reentered his life, John desperately wants her to stay&amp;#8212;and not merely to help him snare the criminal who is ruining them both. But winning her hardened heart will take more than sweet words and sensuous kisses&amp;#8212;he will have to become the caring, thoughtful husband who is truly worthy of her passion and her love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
