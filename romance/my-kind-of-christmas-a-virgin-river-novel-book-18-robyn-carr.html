          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Virgin River – Now a Netflix original series&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Virgin River – Book 18&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;All I want for Christmas…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Patrick Riordan has always been the gentle, sweet-natured of the Riordan brothers, although these days his easygoing manner is being tested by his career as a navy pilot. Believing nothing could match the adrenaline rush he gets from his job, his world is turned upside down when he meets Jack Sheridan&#39;s very attractive niece.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angie LeCroix comes to Virgin River to spend Christmas relaxing, away from her well-intentioned but over-bearing mother. Yet instead of freedom, she gets Jack Sheridan! If her uncle had his way, she&#39;d never go out again. And certainly not with rugged, handsome Patrick Riordan. But Angie has her own idea of the kind of Christmas she wants—and the kind of man!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Patrick and Angie thought they wanted to be left alone this Christmas—until they meet each other! But the Sheridan and Riordan families have different plans for Patrick and Angie—and for Christmas, Virgin River-style!&lt;/p&gt;
