  <title>Kiss Marry Kill - Sidney Halston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Sexy and suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;Kiss Marry Kill &lt;/i&gt;is a compulsively great read from first page to last!&quot; - Katee Robert, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Five years ago they fell in love after one whirlwind summer. Now she&#39;s an internationally famous musician and he&#39;s officially out of the military, but when their worlds collide, can they keep things strictly professional? Sweet, thrilling, emotional, and sexy, fall in love with Megan and Jax in &lt;/i&gt;USA Today&lt;i&gt; bestseller Sidney Halston&#39;s &lt;/i&gt;Kiss Marry Kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;He&#39;s been chasing a memory . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was just supposed to be a regular Thursday afternoon...and then he saw her. Sitting in seat L214, one seat over from his at the baseball game, right next to her douche of a soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend. An impromptu kiss for the kiss cam, and Jax knew his life would never be the same. Five years and a tour in Afghanistan later, Jax is back stateside running his own private security firm, Iron-Clad, with his best friend. He isn&#39;t the man he used to be... but Megan isn&#39;t the sexy and sweet, though sheltered, twenty-two-year-old he left behind, either. And she&#39;s in trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;...but now they&#39;re on the run.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Megan Cruz has made something of herself. She&#39;s turned her dreams of pop stardom into a reality. But when a deadly stalker breaks into her home claiming to be her number-one fan, the only person she can turn to is the boy who got away. But Jax isn&#39;t the same carefree charmer who stole her heart, then broke it when he joined the military. This man is seductive, hard, guarded.  And he&#39;ll do anything to protect what&#39;s his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I rooted for this couple right from their hysterical meet-cute! This hot, overprotective action hero will leave you swooning.&quot; - Tessa Bailey, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;" />
