      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;La Scrittore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A new book Sensation is here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Love, Scandal, Intrigue And Murder; It&lt;br&gt;
Was All Happening in Newarks First&lt;br&gt;
Ward In Turn Of The Century America.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maria loved her life in Italy.  She had wonderful parents, Giovanni, her doting husband, a brand new baby, and a successful farm.  But it was an idyllic life that wouldnt last.  Soon her parents were dead.  High taxes and a poor return on their crops meant that they were unable to keep the land and farmhouse from foreclosure, so they decided they would move to America.  He would go first, find a job and a home, and then he would send for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the two and a half years that she was to wait for her husbands call, Maria supports herself and young son by being La Scrittore (pron. scree tor ay); she would write and read letters for those who couldnt.  Finally after years of waiting, she gets the letter from her husband that she has long been dreaming of.  She is going to America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maria, like many immigrants, came to America with big ideas full of hope for a new life with her family.  What lay in store for her, however, was a life she could have never expected.  With her husband getting deeper and deeper into the Mafia and extra marital affairs, Maria finds herself more and more isolated in a land that was hostile to outsiders.  Antonio, Giovannis roommate and best friend, helps her through, but she ends up getting much more than she bargained for.  In a time of strict Christian piety and marriages that didnt end, Maria would find hard choices to make.  It takes a strong woman to survive in 19th century America!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Discover the real-life story of Maria, who immigrated to Newark, NJs First Ward at the turn-of-the 20th century looking for a life.  What she ended up with would be far different from the dreams she had back in her native Italy.  Her determination and perseverance carry her through, and make the rest of the family stronger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;La Scrittore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Historical Fact Or Creative Fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This historical novel tells the tale of one womans journey from provincial life on a country farm in her native Italy to her turbulent new life as an immigrant in the fast growing and infamous First Ward of Newark, NJ (USA).  The book is based on a true story and the author paints a colorful picture if what it was like growing up and living in an overcrowded and close-knit community.  If youve ever wanted to see with a birds eye view the daily living of your ancestors, then this book is for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;A Woman Scorned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;A Man Manipulated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Giovanni thinks hes helping his family with the extra income from a part-time job, but soon discovers that it comes with unexpected consequences.  Can he get out while theres still time, or will he be pulled into a world from which there is no escape?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;A Helpful Friend&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Antonio only wanted to be a good husband, father and friend.  He worked hard for his family, building a business alone in America so they could travel from Italy with success assured.  But something very unexpected happened along the way and although his family is taken care of, they end up losing the only thing important to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;La Scrittore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Find out how these real life characters changed not only the course of their lives, but also those of the people around them.  Its an amazing story that is unbelievable and yet completely true.  You simply couldnt make this stuff up!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
