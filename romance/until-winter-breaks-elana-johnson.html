  <title>Until Winter Breaks - Elana Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jared Newton can&amp;#39;t believe he&amp;#39;s returning to Redwood Bay, the town he escaped when he was only sixteen years old. But he&amp;#39;s back, because he lost his job in Denver - and lost his heart to his ex-girlfriend - and he&amp;#39;s looking to start fresh.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Too bad starting fresh doesn&amp;#39;t include being spied on and reported to the Sheriff for surfing during a storm. His annoying neighbor, Millie Larson, does both of those, and if she wasn&amp;#39;t so beautiful and fragile, Jared might just look the other way.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Jared is drawn to Millie and the attraction between them is hot and instant. Sure, she might rub him the wrong way sometimes, but he actually likes it. And he definitely gets her riled up in the best way possible. But Jared knows she&amp;#39;s hiding something, and Millie&amp;#39;s not sure about getting involved with the returned bad boy who rode into town on a motorcycle. Can Jared and Millie navigate the obstacles between them to find a new happily-ever-after?" />
