  <title>Ride All Night - Michele de Winton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Enter the gritty biker world of the Raising Hellfire MC series where these L.A. bikers drink hard, drive fast, and dig deep for love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good girl Beth Ravens is waiting for her big Hollywood break but is currently broke, so she&#39;s stuck waitressing at the Wilde Hotel, home of the Raising Hellfire biker club, the biggest collection of dirty bike leather this side of the Hollywood hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Beth, Wilde&#39;s has a resident rising star, Grim McKinley, currently using the Hell&#39;s Boys as research for a biker role. Grim&#39;s hot, and he&#39;s the only perfect gentleman among her regulars. If Beth can hitch herself to his growing fame, she might get a shot at silver screen glory herself. But when she sneaks into Grim&#39;s hotel room and into his bed, Beth finds the wrong McKinley under the covers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad boy biker Rusty McKinley is used to women in his bed and doesn&#39;t blink when he finds one at Wilde&#39;s. But Beth&#39;s prim reaction to her mistake isn&#39;t what Rusty expects. He&#39;s on the lookout for a woman to front an upcoming TV show about his garage, and Beth seems like the perfect match for him and his show. All he has to do is convince Beth he&#39;s a better bet than his brother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ride All Night &lt;/i&gt;is an exciting, sexy read that will take readers for a drive they won&#39;t be able to forget from &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Michele De Winton!&lt;/p&gt;" />
