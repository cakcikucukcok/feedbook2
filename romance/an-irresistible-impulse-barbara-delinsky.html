  <title>An Irresistible Impulse - Barbara Delinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Barbara Delinsky understands the power of the human heart as few others and she shares that gift in this touching novel of acceptance and fulfillment, first published in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting in a Vermont jury room, Abby Barnes is happy to be empaneled. The trial is a sensational headline-grabber, and the thought of being sequestered for a few weeks is appealing. The time away from a relationship that fails to excite her will give her a chance to think . . . and to make a long overdue decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she meets fellow juror Ben Wyeth, a witty and charming college professor who shows Abby just what she&#39;s been missing. But although they share grueling days of grisly testimony and long nights of passion, there is a part of Ben that he can never share with Abby, or any woman. Just as the fate of an accused man lies in the balance, so too does Abby&#39;s, as she decides whether what Ben can give is enough . . . enough to last her a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;" />
