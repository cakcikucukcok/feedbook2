          &lt;em&gt;This was supposed to be paradise&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s why Tim Wainwright moved his three children to Williamston, Tennessee, population 123. It was to be a refuge from the tragedy that had fractured their lives, a place where Tim could forget his mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what the place meant to Nancy Mayfield. The veterinary technician thought she had finally achieved balance and peace in her life, and had put her past behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except no one and no place is perfect–not even Williamston. But maybe two imperfect people make one whole lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
