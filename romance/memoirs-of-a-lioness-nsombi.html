  <title>Memoirs of a Lioness - Nsombi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Memoirs of a Lioness 
Being in love is not where Zanaysha Harris pictured her life. Her life was perfect with her new bakery and her sexual desires being met by her friend with benefits D.L. Everything was going according to her life&#39;s design until a sexy dark chocolate doctor by the name of Darnell Hampton walked into her bakery one late night. From that night Zanaysha only envisioned love, passion, and great, mind blowing, love making. But old habits die hard.
Zanaysha loses the one man she fell so deeply in love with in a moment of playing games with  jealously. Broken hearted she leaves everything behind to find herself and heal from the horrible breakup. During her time away she writes in a journal as a therapeutic tool. 
Zanaysha recounts of sexual encounters that were laced with passion, body numbing, great sex provided the release she needs to reboot her life and live again." />
