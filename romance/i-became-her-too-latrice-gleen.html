  <title>I Became Her Too - Latrice Gleen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We continue on Samanthas journey.
Samantha, as we know, is very successful when it comes to handling her business; she has a beautiful daughter and a man who truly adores her. With all these great things going on in her life, you would think she has it all together and makes the right decisions, right? Samantha almost lost everything with one bad decision that could have changed her entire life. 
When it comes to love, will she win or lose? Will she marry Edward? Can she learn how to submit to him and only him, or will she destroy her happiness because she cant resist the temptations of her past? Shes going through a custody battle with her childs father, relocating to a new city, and shes exhausted. 
Sometimes, the person with the perfect life is not always happy inside. Shes beautiful, but what is she missing? 
 We continue on her journey to see who she did become. 
A child with a married man brought a custody battle.
A woman with trust issues brought doubts.
Sex brought pleasure.
A good man brought love.
Betrayal brought violence.
Hurt and violence brought pain.
Pain almost cost someone their life.
If you can relate to Being Mary Jane, youll love this book." />
