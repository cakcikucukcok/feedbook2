  <title>When the Stars Come Out - Laura Trentham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cottonbloom. A beautiful, faraway place where a woman can escape her past--and find reason to stay forever. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Willa Brown never planned to stay in Cottonbloom. She was on the way to somewhere else when she landed there and found work at the Abbot brothers&#39; garage. . .and a sense of comfort and safety that she had never known. The same holds true for Jackson Abbott himself. With one glance in her direction, he can make Willa&#39;s heart melt. But what begins as an unrequited crush turns into something far more powerful than Willa could have ever imagined. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Jackson&#39;s most meaningful relationship has always been with his car--and he&#39;s not afraid to admit it. Still, he can&#39;t help but become emotionally entangled with his new star mechanic Willa, who is definitely hiding some dark secrets of her own beneath the hood. Jackson desperately wants Willa to trust him, and to seek protection in his arms. But even as the two slowly surrender to their shared attraction, the danger lurking in Willa&#39;s past remains a stubborn obstacle. Can she open up enough to give them both a chance at having real and lasting love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
