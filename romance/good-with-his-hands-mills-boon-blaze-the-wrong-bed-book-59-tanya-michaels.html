  <title>Good with His Hands (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (The Wrong Bed, Book 59) - Tanya Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The right man for the job&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Real estate agent Danica Yates did everything right. She found the right man, waited the right amount of time to get engaged and planned the perfect wedding. Then everything went very, very wrong. Now Dani is left with one unworn bridal gown, one canceled honeymoon and one jerk of an ex-fiancé. The bright side? She can finally make her move on the gorgeous man known only as Hot Architect…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except that Sean Grayson is actually Hot Architect&#39;s Even Hotter Twin Brother. But before Sean can admit his real identity, the chemistry between them takes over, fierce and demanding. He can&#39;t refuse her, or turn away from the blinding want that consumes them both. He knows he has to admit the truth…and convince Dani that the wrong brother is definitely the right man!&lt;/p&gt;
