Vowing never to bow to this ruthless master&#39;s will, the young Englishwoman weakens within the silken splendor of his chambers, and after on glance into his piercing emerald eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stunningly handsome Pasha is a powerful, muscular figure yet he caresses the lovely addition to his harem with a fond tenderness that only succeeds in driving her wild.
