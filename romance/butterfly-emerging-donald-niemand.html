  <title>Butterfly Emerging - Donald Niemand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Trisha Romano has been evicted from her apartment and is struggling to find lodging for her son Mario and herself as winter approaches.  She is forced to carry him to the hospital emergency ward in a snowstorm when he collapses at a homeless shelter.  In the recovery room she meets an older man who offers them lodging and a chance for a new life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her benefactor encourages Trisha to improve herself through education and training.  She finds she is capable of far more than she thought and accepts increasingly more challenging positions. As her career progresses, she discovers that her beauty opens doors she thought were unobtainable.
In the process of enhancing her education and work experience, she also attracts several suitors. Making a choice is the hardest thing she must do. Will it be the son of her benefactor, a fellow student, or the plastic surgeon who restored her beauty after the accident? Or will she return to the husband who deserted her in a futile attempt to make his fortune?&lt;/P&gt;" />
