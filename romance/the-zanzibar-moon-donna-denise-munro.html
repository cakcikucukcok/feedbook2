She helps abandoned mothers set up a self-sustainable refuge at a ramshackle beach resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s; a brawny exotic man walking a cheetah, a wizened woman with an ancient lamp, an old journal with secret pages, giant tortoises in caves and the wonderful eccentric characters of The Peace Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kendwa Ely&lt;/strong&gt; is a wild and sexy adventurer. Sparks fly between him and Ali, and though he may be the Tarzan of her dreams, he comes with complications; a three-year-old son and a mysterious job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don Cloutier&lt;/strong&gt; the island&amp;rsquo;s doctor struggles with his own demons; drink, women and temptation.

Can he make her see sense, or is he just wasting his time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Ali&amp;#39;s husband can&amp;#39;t make up his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ali can&amp;rsquo;t resist appealing Kendwa, and will his past come back to haunt them both?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a medical emergency sends her racing home, she renews her family bond, uncovers a new betrayal and finds an inner strength from her time with Kendwa in exotic Zanzibar and the wilds of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But on her return to the island will the grief of what she finds overwhelm her?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You actually have a lot of content in the book and the story line is an interesting &amp;quot;Chick Lit&amp;quot; and reminded me of Janet Evanovich series a lot. The mix of dialogue and locations made the book move and the way that the character travelled allowed you to explore lots of options for material. I could tell you had written it - it really came from your soul and your experiences/loves. There is a real mix of chick lit, travel, suspense and tear jerking.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Angela Spzjoda (owner of 360 Degree Wellness)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I loved it. I really felt like I was walking the narrow lanes of Zanzibar and that I was taken on an African safari. It was a unique and beautifully written story. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read anything like it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Valerie Ibbotson (retired)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I finished reading The Zanzibar Moon and absolutely loved it, Donna. I didn&amp;rsquo;t predict the ending either. It&amp;rsquo;s exotic, funny and full of adventure. It&amp;rsquo;s also inspired me to go to Zanzibar one day.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Leesa Bennett (volunteer teacher abroad)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I thoroughly enjoyed being in Africa. I think women will love reading this, as it is most women&amp;rsquo;s fantasy at some point.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Tracy Wilkinson (target reader)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am really impressed by the book, you have really done your homework and if I did not l know any better I would have sworn that you have lived in Africa for a period of time.&amp;nbsp; You have captured life here so well with the chaos, the beauty, the nature, even down to the sometimes not so pleasant aromas (haha).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The story line is great and the characters are interesting.&amp;nbsp; I also like how you have put the relevant chapters in the first tense for Alkina and Dr Don. &amp;nbsp;It lets you get closer to the character I think.&amp;nbsp; I showed some of the Swahili to my colleague and as far as she could tell you were spot on.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Kerry Zillner (UN in Africa)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donna Munro&amp;rsquo;s debut novel&amp;nbsp;has a unique writer&amp;rsquo;s voice that is engaging and witty. This is a well-researched story, blended with magical undertones in a contemporary setting. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-written easy read. It will stay with you long after the moon sets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
