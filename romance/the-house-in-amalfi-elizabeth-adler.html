  <title>The House in Amalfi - Elizabeth Adler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let Elizabeth Adler sweep you away to the dramatic cliffs and ocean of Italy&#39;s Amalfi coast, in this novel of secrets, memories, and unexpected love...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamour Harrington&#39;s husband died two years ago. Since then, she has immersed herself in her landscape architecture, but even creating beautiful outdoor &quot;rooms&quot; can&#39;t bring back her sense of peace. When she&#39;s faced with a devastating truth about the husband she adored, Lamour needs a place to recharge.  She returns to the house on the Amalfi coast where she&#39;d lived with her father during the happiest years of her childhood. But the house of her memories has secrets all its own, forcing her to face new truths about another man she once loved.  Was her father&#39;s death truly accidental? Or was he hiding something that caused his early demise?  Torn between two mysterious and compelling men, Lamour discovers that the past has a way of returning when you least expect it.  And someone wants to ensure that Lamour doesn&#39;t uncover the secrets of this idyllic, dreamy coastal getaway.  As the past and the present collide in a shattering and suspenseful climax, Lamour must face the things she fears the most, in order to find the courage to live life to the fullest.  &lt;i&gt;The House in Amalfi&lt;/i&gt; is addictively page-turning, a novel to tantalize every sense and keep you spellbound.&lt;/p&gt;" />
