  <title>Innocence - C. Nault,  M. Findley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Two secret societies, fighting for control of a technology that could alter the fate of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
An assassin, bound to protect knowledge left long ago by visitors from another galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;
And a woman, caught in the crossfire...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the first time he meets Rachel, Adam Black can&amp;#39;t help being attracted. But he knows the athletic redhead is off-limits. She&amp;#39;s a civilian, and he... isn&amp;#39;t. He guards secrets with deadly consequences, and letting Rachel into his life would destroy hers. Keeping her at a distance is the only way to protect her, but despite his best efforts, their attraction grows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the first time she meets Adam, Rachel Flanagan knows she&amp;#39;s in trouble. Arrogant, cocky, and mysterious, the extreme sports instructor both annoys and fascinates her. She realizes she should stay away from him, and yet she keeps coming back for more. Though she&amp;#39;s always had rotten luck with bad boys, maybe this time will be different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If she&amp;#39;d known that finally giving in to their mutual desire would throw her in the middle of a nightmare, she might never have signed up for his class. Now, with killers from Adam&amp;#39;s past hot on their heels and no time for explanations, Rachel needs to decide who she can trust before it&amp;#39;s too late." />
