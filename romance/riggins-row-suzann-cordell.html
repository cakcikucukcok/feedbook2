  <title>Riggins Row - Suzann Cordell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most white folks refer to Riggins Row as a shanty town. No white man would dare show up there unless it was daylight. No self-respecting white woman would be caught there at all. But for Johnny Ruth and Hessie, its home. All of their relatives had lived and died right there on the Row.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Ruth and Hessie grew up together, becoming best friends and neighbors, living side by side on Riggins Row in the middle of a small rural town in Tennessee. Its 1953, and both women are domestic maids who feel privileged to be working for prominent families who treat them well. Its a better situation than most other domestics have in these parts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Ruth works for the Porters, the wealthiest family in the county. Charles Porter, a well-to-do attorney, is closely connected to the Ku Klux Klan. His beautiful wife, Savannah, is concealing her sordid, secretive past. Unlike her husband, however, Savannah doesnt have a racist bone in her body. When Charles hires Jasper Thomas, a black man, to be Savannahs driver, he has no idea that Jasper and Savannah will become best friends and confidants, adding fuel to an already smoldering fire within the community.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Quick to notice this friendship, Johnny Ruth warns them of the far-reaching affects this taboo relationship could havenot only on them, but their families, friends, and possibly the whole town.&lt;/p&gt;" />
