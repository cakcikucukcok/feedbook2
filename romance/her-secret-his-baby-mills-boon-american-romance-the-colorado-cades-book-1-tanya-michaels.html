  <title>Her Secret, His Baby (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) (The Colorado Cades, Book 1) - Tanya Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Life’s been full of surprises lately for rancher Garrett Frost – and not in a good way. His mother has just dropped a bombshell about his past, so Garrett takes some time away to come to terms with family secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And who should he run into? Arden Cade, the beautiful photographer who shared a single night of passion with Garrett six months ago. He is even more shocked when he discovers she&#39;s pregnant–and he&#39;s the daddy. To make matters worse, Arden hadn’t even planned on telling Garrett about the baby. Despite her lies, Garrett is determined to be a good father. He’s not the type to cut and run, and he can’t deny that he’s falling for Arden all over again. But he’ll have to find a way to forgive her betrayal … and make peace with that skeleton in the family closet.&lt;/p&gt;
