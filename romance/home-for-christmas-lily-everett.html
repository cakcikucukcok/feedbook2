  <title>Home for Christmas - Lily Everett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Celebrate Christmas on Sanctuary Island, where the love light gleams. There will be snow and mistletoe...and two lonely hearts yearning for love, family, and above all, home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magazine columnist Libby Leeds has made a name for herself sharing heartwarming stories from her perfect life on Sanctuary Island. There&#39;s just one minor detail she&#39;s left out: she hasn&#39;t set foot on the island since her childhood. Orphaned and heartbroken, she departed years ago and never looked back-except in her fictional columns. Now a wounded war hero is returning to Sanctuary Island, and Libby&#39;s editor insists she cover the story by taking the long road back...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;HOME FOR CHRISTMAS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army Ranger Owen Shepard is a tall, handsome single father, and now a media sensation. He wants to reconnect with his daughter, Caitlin, and make up for lost time by giving her a Christmas to remember. When &quot;America&#39;s Favorite Homemaker&quot; Libby Leeds offers her help, he jumps at the chance. But the sweet, reclusive writer is more intriguing, and more tempting, than Owen could have imagined. Soon, Owen and Caitlin are spending their holiday with Libby, decorating trees, making gingerbread houses, and warming up by the fire. It&#39;s the closest Libby has come to love and family since she was a child-but until she and Owen admit what is in their hearts, the home they are creating together will be only in their dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Sanctuary Island will live in your heart long after the book is closed.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  -Susan Wiggs, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;" />
