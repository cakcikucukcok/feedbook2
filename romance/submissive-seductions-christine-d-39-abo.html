The chance to bring her secret fantasy to life, to be a submissive&amp;mdash;even just for one night&amp;mdash;was worth any price. And Gareth was everything she wanted in a Master. He touched, he taught, he tantalized. He opened her world to pleasures she&amp;rsquo;d never imagined. But was it enough? &lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; After one night turned into a blurred-line relationship, Liz&amp;rsquo;s feelings for Gareth went beyond desire. Yet the kink, no matter how hot, had her wondering if she could ever have a normal relationship. Her Dom was a man with a tragic past and he&amp;rsquo;d put rules in place from the start.&amp;#160; If Liz chose to break them would she lose the intense passion she&amp;rsquo;d just discovered&amp;mdash;as well as the man she loved?...&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Praise for Chistine d&amp;rsquo;Abo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;30 Days&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sexy, fun and deeply emotional.

In fact 30 days was a stand out read for me last year. I was very excited to read Submissive Seductions. It sounded like a perfect book for me and I did enjoy several parts, but I am left quite torn now that I am done reading.<br /><b><i>Submissive Seductions: d'Abo, Christine: 9781601834751 ...</i></b> | Submissive Seductions - Kindle edition by d'Abo, Christine. Download it once and read it on your Kindle device, PC, phones or tablets. Use features like bookmarks, note taking and highlighting while reading Submissive Seductions.<br /><b><i>Submissive Seductions - Kindle edition by d'Abo, Christine ...</i></b> | Submissive Seductions by Christine d'Abo is a nice little love story of lust and trust issues between a Dom and his new submissive.
