  <title>I Dare You - Rachael Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty nine year old Charlotte Baker is single and an unemployed journalist desperate to land her dream job at &lt;em&gt;The Westerly&lt;/em&gt;; Perth&amp;#39;s number one newspaper. After a run of mishaps and a misunderstanding that her pet dachshund George is actually a two month old baby, she finds herself not interviewing for the newspaper but its sister subscription &lt;em&gt;Dare Baby&lt;/em&gt;, a magazine written by parents for parents. Despite the obvious lack of qualifications - she&amp;#39;s not a parent - Charlotte is desperate for a job and accepts the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Jackson Craig, CEO of the &lt;em&gt;The Westerly&amp;#39;s &lt;/em&gt;publishing company. Although it appears they have a mutual attraction, Charlotte can&amp;#39;t help but wonder whether his increasing interest in her is for personal reasons or can he sense that she is not who she says she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realising that she is just one photo shoot away from being exposed, Charlotte must decide whether she is willing to keep up the single mother pretence for the sake of employment or to put the possibility for success and happiness on the line, take responsibility for her choices and admit the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
