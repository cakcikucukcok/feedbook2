  <title>Courted - Bull Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Linus Abrams is hired to check on the mental well-being of a former magistrate judge Wilbur Conrad Sr. Abrams is near satisfied that his evaluation is nothing more than a goose-chase for Conrad&amp;rsquo;s male heir to get his hands on his fortune, then the subject of Jean-Pierre comes up. Who is Jean-Pierre, you may ask? He is a virile Creole slave that died more than a century ago that Mr. Conrad has taken on as a lover.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that?&amp;rdquo; Abrams interrupted and asked after some time with the flashed from earlier retuning in much more lasting forms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That?&amp;rdquo; Conrad repeated a bit more hesitant, &amp;ldquo;Off the record?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Of course,&amp;rdquo; Abrams offered, instinctively crossing his heart as if he were a child.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conrad placed his fingers on the book, touching it as if he was marveling it for the very first time. &amp;ldquo;This is how I found out about Jean-Pierre.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The infamous Jean-Pierre,&amp;rdquo; Abrams mouthed. &amp;ldquo;What does that have to do with him? With all due respect, the book looks to be older than you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;One hundred and thirty-six years older than me, to be exact. Jean-Pierre was a Creole stud slave that roamed around these parts many years ago.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Wait a minute,&amp;rdquo; Abrams paused, thinking about his earlier conversation about this mysterious man as a sudden headache pressed itself, trying to remember if Conrad was talking in the present. &amp;ldquo;You spoke of this man as if he lives in the here and now, like he was a good friend of yours or something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He is, Mr. Abrams. He has been a very comforting friend of mine throughout the years.&amp;rdquo;" />
