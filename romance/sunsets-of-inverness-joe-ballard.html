  <title>Sunsets of Inverness - Joe Ballard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Im not young anymore, Andy. Im in the sunset of my life. Time is quickly ticking by. And I was never good at being a bachelor like you. I need to be with somebody, and I think Annie is the one.
So claims Harold Barker, a sixty-six-year-old resident of Tomales Bay, California in this sweet and poignant exploration of love in later years. 
Having taken a part time job as a paper delivery man, Harold becomes attracted to a woman on his route, Annie Emerson, and although his attempts at initiating a romantic involvement with her begin auspiciously, he is unexpectedly rebuffed as both must come to grips with the ghosts and memories of past loves. Clarity for Annie eventually comes from a young woman, Emily Ruckus, who Annie once guided away from suicide while for Harold assistance comes from his close-knit group of friends in Operation Woo. 
In Sunsets of Inverness we find a couple struggling with what we all must come to terms within our waning years, the loss of life partners, and the search for meaning." />
