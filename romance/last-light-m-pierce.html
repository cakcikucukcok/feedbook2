      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tensions rise, secrets grow bigger, and passions run deeper&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;and hotter&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;in Last Light, the second novel of the Night Owl Trilogy from bestselling author M. Pierce.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Sky is missing. After a solo ascent of Longs Peak that left only a large blood stain, tatters of climbing clothing, and the tracks of an animal in the snow, he is presumed dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah Catalano is guarding a secret: she knows Matt is alive. After Matt&#39;s memorial service, she lingers on the East Coast with his family, but it soon becomes clear that his brothers&#39; motives are less than gracious. Nate Sky is bent on tracking down the author of Night Owl, a book that charts the last days of Matt&#39;s life with uncanny and scandalous accuracy, and which appeared only after his death. Seth Sky is bent on getting Hannah into his bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden away in the woods, Matt and Hannah strive desperately to maintain their ruse and their relationship-but their web of lies only tightens as Matt struggles with the consequences of his decision, and Hannah tries to escape Nate&#39;s libel suit and fend off Seth&#39;s advances...until Hannah is put in danger, and Matt must make a life or death choice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
