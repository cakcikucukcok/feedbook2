  <title>The Serendipity of Marriage - Michal D. Winters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Serendipity of Marriage is based on biblical scripture teaching.  Winters as a minister have been consoling men, women, and couples for over twenty years discussing their difference in the behavior of the opposite gender. To help them better understand their role in their relationship, Winters would direct them to scripture, where they are able to feel their role within their relationship.  Marriage is a sacred union before God, it does not matter how difficult your relationship is, with your husband or wife, because if you first have that relationship between you and God, then your relationship between your husband or wife will be a benefactor of your relationship with God.  We should not go into marriage, because of money or other material wants, but it should be based on LOVE and only LOVE, everything else that you receive after marriage would be a blessing from God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
