  <title>Escape to Erotica - Maxim Jakubowski, Kitty Lucious, Demelza Hart, L W...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A collection of five winning stories from the &#39;Escape to Erotica&#39; competition held by Xcite Books and Erotica. With a central theme of &#39;escape&#39; these stories offer the readers a wonderful opportunity to leave behind their daily lives and escape to somewhere far more pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olive Oil and Another World by Maxim Jacubowski&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A London journalist and a beautiful woman meet at a Food Trade Fair in Paris where she is selling extra pure virgin olive oil. They meet, connect and both dream of escape to other shores. Will the relationship survive the night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escape by Kitty Luscious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lara Groves is escaping to the Scilly Isles. The remote cottage she has hired has no internet, no phone line and no mobile reception. But she is not quite cut off from the outside world.&amp;#160; When two sexy young surfers offer to pop by and check she&amp;#8217;s OK Lara doesn&amp;#8217;t refuse them.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;In fact, when she sees their gorgeous fit young bodies at close quarters, Lara realises she is not about to refuse them anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swept Away by Demelza Hart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitty is breaking free &amp;#8211; a few days road trip with no plans other than to find an adventure &amp;#8211; what could be better? Picking up a fellow traveller is not part of her plans, but he&amp;#8217;s certainly easy on the eye. And when he introduces her to his equally gorgeous friend, who owns a secluded restaurant in the mountains, Kitty finds herself on an adventure she couldn&amp;#8217;t have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flight by Ian Perrott&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long haul flight on a half empty plane, Jennifer isn&amp;#8217;t pleased when the seats on either side of her are occupied at the last minute by two men. She&amp;#8217;d been hoping to catch up on her sleep. But the guys have other plans for Jennifer and she happily swaps sleep for the prospect of her own personal sexy in flight entertainment. Except that she soon discovers the two men aren&amp;#8217;t quite what they seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elle&amp;#8217;s Present from Charlie by LW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie is Elle&amp;#8217;s long distance lover. They talk every day and he sends sensual presents from Australia, although they never meet.&amp;#160; But a virtual lover isn&amp;#8217;t enough for Elle &amp;#8211; she needs more.&amp;#160; Charlie may be far away but James, her new engineer, is right in front of her and he&amp;#8217;s happy to be a real live substitute for Charlie any time she likes.;&lt;/p&gt;" />
