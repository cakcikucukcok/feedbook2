        &lt;p&gt;CONNOR RIORDAN WAS THE LAST PERSON SHE WANTED TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE WITH…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even if it was only at her brother&#39;s wedding. It was too painful a reminder of Beth Curtis&#39;s girlhood fantasies, featuring none other than Connor himself. That crush had culminated in one night of passion and seven years of bitterness; and even now, Beth&#39;s anger warred against her attraction toward Connor. Still, there was too much history–too many secrets–that would prevent her from ever loving him again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when a storm strands the two together, Beth is in for a surprise. Connor has a secret of his own. He plans on seducing Beth–a seduction seven years in the making….&lt;/p&gt;
