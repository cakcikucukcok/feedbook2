  <title>Poetry Book for the Absolute Love of Women - Daniel Moran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This poetry book has been inspired by many women with women in mind. One woman has been the centerfold of this book and has struck me with great profoundness. I hope you enjoy the contents and my depictions of them for your own growth and power in love. I look out into the world and see relationships without true power. Divorce rates rising, domestic disputes in repetition. My hope and goal is that after reading my poems, you garner more power and worth in your relationship or relationship to come. It was a pleasure to write this for you all, and I have another book named &quot;Pain and Change&quot; being released soon. It brings me one step closer to reaching her. The one I wrote this book forunspoken, unsaid mystery. Keep in touch and enjoy your life!" />
