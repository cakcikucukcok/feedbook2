  <title>When God Speaks - Frances Ann Spillers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in writing since the second grade, but it was only after I trusted in God and began a close walk with Him that I have written this book. God truly has spoken to my heart and allowed me to write the poetry and prose found in When God Speaks. This is a book that has been written from life experiences and deep meditation. I write about many joys and sorrows that come straight from the heart. Many of the words are the way I perceive life in and through others. People are a blessing and are meant to be encouraged and filled with love and happiness. It is with joy that I share my thoughts, poetry, and prose with family and friends and, yes, with strangers yet to become friends. I hope you find this book a joy and an encouragement to read again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
