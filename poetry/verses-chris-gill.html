  <title>Verses - Chris Gill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A collection of contemporary poetry&amp;nbsp;by independent author, Chris Gill. Penned over the course of a decade,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Verses&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;details the writer&amp;rsquo;s journey into adulthood, as he reflects on his past, present and future. It also makes observations about the world on a social, political and spiritual scale, which will leave you deep in thought and often able to relate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The collection is split into six parts that tackle issues on both a macro and micro scale. Kicking off with the confessional &lt;em&gt;Catacombs&lt;/em&gt;, the book promises to take its reader on an existential trip as the author picks apart fragments of his memory. The book then continues with &lt;em&gt;Escape to the Docks&lt;/em&gt;, a darker, even haunting section that presents the reader with a narrative of the writer&amp;rsquo;s student life. Expect themes ranging from hedonism to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The third part of the book, titled &lt;em&gt;Home&lt;/em&gt;, reverts back in time to the author&amp;rsquo;s childhood. Here we&amp;rsquo;re given an intimate insight into the poet&amp;#39;s early years through dream-like prose. The fourth section of the book, &lt;em&gt;Wires&lt;/em&gt;, sees the experimental writer turn far more outward as he openly expresses his political views and concerns about the environment. This section includes the epic poem &lt;em&gt;Wires&lt;/em&gt;, which takes the reader on a powerful exploration into the author&amp;rsquo;s inner psyche.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The final two parts, &lt;em&gt;Oracles under City Lights&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Other Side&lt;/em&gt;, follow Chris&amp;rsquo; life in both London and Sydney, with all the lessons taught along the way through the people he encountered and situations he found himself in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you think poetry is dull and outdated, &lt;em&gt;Verses&lt;/em&gt; will open your mind and give you a taste of how contemporary poetry looks, sounds and feels. It proves that poetry, just like any other art form, exists to provoke emotion and empathy within its reader; leaving you enthralled and wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
