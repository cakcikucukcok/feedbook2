  <title>Touch - Henri Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Henri Cole&#39;s last three books have shown a continuously mounting talent. In his new book, &lt;i&gt;Touch&lt;/i&gt;, written with an almost invisible but ever-present art, he continues to render his human topics--a mother&#39;s death, a lover&#39;s addiction, war--with a startling clarity. Cole&#39;s new poems are impelled by a dark knowledge of the body--both its pleasures and its discontents--and they are written with an aesthetic asceticism in the service of truth. Alternating between innocence and violent self-condemnation, between the erotic and the elegiac, and between thought and emotion, these poems represent a kind of mid-life selving that chooses life. With his simultaneous impulses to privacy and to connection, Cole neutralizes pain with understatement, masterful cadences, precise descriptions of the external world, and a formal dexterity rarely found in contemporary American poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Touch &lt;/i&gt;is a Publishers Weekly Best Poetry Books title for 2011.&lt;/p&gt;" />
