  <title>Coming  into My Wisdom - Kaya Kamins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After the break up of a long distance relationship, Kaya began to write from the depths of her soul while struggling to become empowered and grounded in her own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who I had become was someone I didnt really know. This woman didnt fit the stereotypes I had grown up with. I had not been raised to have a voice, nor to know my truth. When I began to write, floodgates began to open. I developed a new clarity about my emotions. This replaced the space in my heart and life where there was once only confusion and uncertainty. As I began to write and share my words with other women, I developed more courage and began to overcome my fears about creating my own unique path to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kayas poems about her journey of self-discovery and transformation at midlife have common themes for all women struggling to give birth to their own voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
