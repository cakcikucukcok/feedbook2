  <title>Legend and Legacy of the Dark Knight - Christopher Goben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From out of the dark ages to the heart of modern times comes the one known no other then the Dark Knight. He is one who lives, by the old ways of the sword. He is a legendary man of valor, honor and nobleness. He is one who can only live, by the code of chivalry. As he now comes forth to you from the pages of his poems.  Learn now of his misunderstood romantic heart. See why he bears the dark suit of armor. Feel the sorrow that clings in a single tear behind his dark helm. So walk lightly in his forbidden lair of darkness. Walk with him while he shows onto you the old mysteries of his ways. Learn of his faith, his hunger, his desires in the word, and that of his haunting rage. As here sets before you the Legend and Legacy of the Dark Knight." />
