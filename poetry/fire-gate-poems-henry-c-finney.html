  <title>Fire Gate Poems - Henry C. Finney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fire Gate Poems: A Journey of Spiritual Healing presents a collection of poems and images that mark author Henry C. Finneys journey from grief to healing following the death of his son. Writing poetry and Zen meditation contributed greatly to his recovery from the unthinkable-the loss of a child. The verses and illustrations provide glimpses of the landscape he traversed during this journey-its darkest jungles of grief, its rolling hills of recovery, and finally its brilliant vistas of love and happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few verses from earlier years (origins), the poems articulate stages of Finneys return to life. They begin with reactions to the tragedy (abyss), continue with poems of return and renewal, and conclude with verses of wonder. His poetic images are enhanced by black-and-white renditions of his drawings, paintings, prints, and photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finneys poems sing of lifes mysteries, sorrows, and beauty; his art celebrates the world. His work demonstrates the healing powers of writing and art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lives of Grasses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering from my deep frozen winter &lt;br&gt;
I wander now&lt;br&gt;
amid a sea of grasses&lt;br&gt;
of new-grown wild flowers&lt;br&gt;
where just last week &lt;br&gt;
(Ive lost track) &lt;br&gt;
snow lay deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No path remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite your absence&lt;br&gt;
summer has secretly returned. &lt;br&gt;
No pretending winter losses any more. &lt;br&gt;
I re-awaken&lt;br&gt;
like this field&lt;br&gt;
whose sea of waving tassels&lt;br&gt;
swishing, aromatic &lt;/p&gt;" />
