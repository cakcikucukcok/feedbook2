  <title>A Shropshire Lad and Last Poems - A. E. Housman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alfred Edward Housman (1859-1936) was an English poet and classical scholar whose work became a major force in turn-of-the-century English poetry. Unlike his contemporaries, Houseman&#39;s poetry does not qualify as Romantic, Victorian or Modernist, and is not overly sentimental or optimistic; instead, his deeply pessimistic and ironic poetry, written clearly and succinctly, earned Housman notoriety as one of the foremost classicists of his time. His best-known work, &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, is a cycle of 63 poems set in a half-imaginative Shropshire, and explores themes of death, the fleetingness of love, and the passing of youth. The poems became increasingly popular at the time of World War I because of their depiction of brave English soldiers. In the early 1920s, Houseman&#39;s closest friend and old Oxford roommate, Moses Jackson, was dying, prompting Housman to compile his &quot;Last Poems&quot; for Jackson to read. The forty-one previously unpublished poems were so titled because Housman felt his inspiration had been exhausted. Indeed, these proved to be his last published works." />
