  <title>The Love of the Rose - Fatih Takmakli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is meant to be a statement to the world; a statement of encouragement and inspiration. The Love of the Rose is set to inspire and develop confidence in ones own beliefs and thoughts.  To believe and think is not taboo and should be developed for all to listen, of course with respect to every one elses opinions and beliefs, and to discuss.  The Love of the Rose was written in inspiration of positive virtues that has been seen in the world through the ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I wrote this book in the best intention to encourage people to speak up and voice their opinions all with respect and politeness.  There is no right or wrong way of developing an opinion as long as it gives the world a better understanding of the various occupants of this place we call home. This book is made with the intention to show people that positive virtues and positive ways of expressing one self is what the world needs to unite, no matter what creed, political views or level of education.  Brotherhood and tolerance amongst people is needed to connect peacefully and allow to freely expressing ourselves in a manner that is not judgmental or oppressive to others, this is needed in a world full of miscommunications and aggressiveness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Love of the Rose is my feelings and my thoughts; they are not to bewilder anyone. They are there to open free speech, peace and another way of thinking.  The more people who are open to their opinions: the more that one can understand. And with understanding from where our neighbors come from will bring tolerance. And with tolerance one can fight for the opinions of others and the feelings that are involved.  This is a step for peace in a micro-societal way.  Inner peace and tolerance comes with understanding of each others thoughts and backgrounds and with all this peace will come in a macro sense." />
