  <title>Poems of Faith - Bambi Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the poetry of Bambi Rose and of a faith that multiplied along the pathway of life until, finally, at the end of her years she achieved the peace of God that passeth all understanding. It was a lifelong struggle to overcome the doubts and uncertainty which assail us all in our quest to believe in our personal salvation and acceptance by God. That she achieved her goal is beyond doubt. In the words of a dear friend and visionary she is now &quot;dancing in the light&quot;. 
Her very early years were idyllic until, at the age of five, she lost her beloved and loving father. The distress engendered by such a hammer blow to a small child is beyond imagining and it&#39;s effects followed her for the rest of her life. Her saving grace was formed by a deep and abiding immersion in the influence of the Catholic Church with it&#39;s Fervent emphasis on obedience and of the potency of it&#39;s message of power and salvation through God. 
The last eighteen years of her life saw her challenged by cancer which attacked her on nine occasions in different ways, the last in both lungs. 
Her steadfast refusal to accept treatment by chemotherapy was testament to her faith in the compassion of God which was complete at her end. She went in happiness and joy." />
