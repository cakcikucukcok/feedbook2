  <title>Love Across Miles, Dreams Come True - David S. Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David of Moorpark, California, USA and Elena of Kherson, Ukraine are soon to be David and Elena Bell. After years of searching for a mystical depth of heart and soul within their own countries, they both decided to look beyond their borders. They met online and realized they had found something special, an answer to their prayers, the realization of their dreams. They met in person and confirmed what they realized in emails and letters. Then, because of visa regulations between their two countries, they had to spend much time apart. But their love grew and flourished across the miles. This book is a collection of many of the poems sent from David to Elena during the anxious days awaiting permission from the US Government for Elena to enter the USA and marry." />
