  <title>At the Foundling Hospital - Robert Pinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Since the death of Robert Lowell in 1977, no single figure has dominated American poetry the way that Lowell, or before him Eliot, once did . . .

These poems reimagine identity on the scale of one life or of human history: from &quot;the emanation of a dead star still alive&quot; to the &quot;pinhole iris of your mortal eye.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is a particular person? How unique? What is anyone born as? Born with? Born into? The poems of Robert Pinsky&#39;s &lt;i&gt;At the Foundling Hospital&lt;/i&gt; engage personality and culture as improvised from loss: a creative effort so pervasive it can be invisible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
