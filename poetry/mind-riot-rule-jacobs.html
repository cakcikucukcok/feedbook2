  <title>Mind*Riot - Rule Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rule Jacobs takes readers on a walk through his mind in his unique poetry collection, &lt;i&gt;Mind*Riot.&lt;/i&gt; His strongly felt opinions, witty phrasing, and brutal honesty capture the essence of life today. While some of his poems conjure powerful images of the give and take that we face in our relationships, others are the lyrical musings of someone who knows and feels life intimately. His poetry is thought-provoking and at times inspirational, transporting anyone who reads it to a place of strong emotions. Jacobs gets to the heart of life and shakes it up with his genre of poetry called spitted word that is inspired by music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;7 Fathoms in Depth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The art of painting ------&lt;br&gt;
is the sketch of ones vision----&lt;br&gt;
Thousands of lost soldiers&lt;br&gt;
Still trapped inside the cells of my brains prison&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No longer confined &lt;br&gt;
I miss you ... &lt;br&gt;
Every time I sneeze you bless me&lt;br&gt;
And in return I kiss you&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have arrived colorless&lt;br&gt;
Yet I am all 16 shades of black&lt;br&gt;
7 fathoms in depth with all I have left&lt;br&gt;
Carved in facts&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The fact that most are copycats&lt;br&gt;
Gives existence to the evidence of ignorance&lt;br&gt;
While creating your designs then sharing them&lt;br&gt;
Gives hope to a sign of intelligence &lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;" />
