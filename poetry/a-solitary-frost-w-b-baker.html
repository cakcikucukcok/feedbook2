  <title>A Solitary Frost - W. B. Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;Fantastic Gothic Images&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;A remarkable accomplishment and body of work, displaying the magnificence and depravity of the being of man. Herein lies some of the most superb classical poetry produced within the last half century, a testament to the superlative skill, intuition, and brilliance of the author.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Seldom will one find such high calibre writing, particularly from the ranks of contemporary writers. Reminiscent of the gothic imagery of Edgar Allen Poe, this poet entwines classical style and mythological references with truly inspirational sentiment and theology. In the epic poem, The Serpents Left Hand, one is truly horrified by the imagery of Hell, and yet, equally inspired by the sublime grandeur of Heaven. Concurrently, the lasting metaphors presented in The Siege at Caerphilly demonstrate the heights and depths of which the human spirit is capable.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Obligatory reading for any individual who might truly understand the nature of man.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;- United Kingdom&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/Center&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In a beautifully lyrical collection of verse, W. B. Baker explores an extensive diversity of literary motifs. The poet uses syntax and rhythm to powerful effect, conveying emotion through the musicality of language whose enduring imagery lingers in the mind long after reading.  With masterful ease, each succeeding composition sweeps the reader into an exhilaration of ascending and descending emotional environments; from the indiscriminate carnage and utter futility of warfare in The Siege at Caerphilly, to passionate sentiments of love in Sonnets for Elisa, to a sinister, disturbingly vivid conception of Hell in The Serpents Left Hand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Particularly memorable are the scenes of slaughter and bloodshed, which perhaps support the Aristotelian perception that what is best in literature often springs from what is worst in life.  Beautiful writing and moving sentiments, whose affecting and enduring images appeal to the most majestic and basest nature of us all.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;- New Millennium Publishing&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;London, England&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Throughout this slender yet profound volume of verse, the author presents shimmering vignettes of heroic and mundane motifs, transmogrified by the lyrical language of bard and poet. Syntax and rhythm combine to convey impressionist harmony in a palate of emotions that range from indiscriminate war carnage to sentimental love sonnets, and from the vivid flashing of hell to sublime familial bonds. Enduring imagery undergirds each succeeding work as the authors skill and art speak to our emotions. In a style that draws from the full, rich well of old language, the poet conveys us into a world that appears, at first, to be but half remembered. The beauty of the writing and the depth of the emotion open a landscape that continues to uphold us even at the dawn of this new millennium. We stop, think, and indeed do fully remember that these enduring images come from the human soul.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CENTER/&gt;&lt;B&gt;- Dr. Daniel P. Larson, Vice President&lt;BR&gt;
MVCC/State University Of New York&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While each poem or component of prose contained within the volume considers a modified facet of the human experience, the author devotes particular emphasis to the expression of the readers realisation of truth rather than simply the poets interpretation of emotional or historical fact. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A Solitary Frost is an eclectic compilation of two significant works, The Siege at Caerphilly and The Serpents Left Hand, along with several abbreviated selections of diverse character. The predominant motifs of human integrity, character, and personal morality are appraised in disparate treatments throughout the volume.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Siege at Caerphilly is based on an actual battle which occurred in 1316 between the English Marcher Lord, Gilbert de Claire, designated as the Lord of Glamorgan by the English monarchy, and the forc" />
