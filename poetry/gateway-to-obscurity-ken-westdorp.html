  <title>Gateway to Obscurity - Ken Westdorp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Honesty is too often obscured by an inability to communicate as we grow older and harbour secrets from those we love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depicting raw emotions along with touches of humour, Gateway to Obscurity reveals a personal expression of the human condition. These verses weave images that explore a wide range of difficult subjects, making the book a resource for the soul and a bold statement on the various elements of emotions that we often deny ourselves. Each poem presents a hidden world of triumph and tragedy, without the religious or scientific clutter that is so often present these days. They address issues relevant in todays ever-changing world, bringing to light a new sense of self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through candid and economical language, this collection of poetry considers the delicate nature of the human condition and is embellished throughout with real-life experience and observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father and Son&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When lifes incidentals&lt;br /&gt;
come to a screeching halt,&lt;br /&gt;
burdened by complications,&lt;br /&gt;
the result of neglected health,&lt;br /&gt;
miracles of medicine&lt;br /&gt;
prevent ultimate disaster.&lt;br /&gt;
However, reckless behaviour&lt;br /&gt;
necessitates lengthy recovery.&lt;br /&gt;
Incapacitated by weakness,&lt;br /&gt;
reduced to an invalid,&lt;br /&gt;
struggling with adversities&lt;br /&gt;
taken previously for granted.&lt;br /&gt;
Minor physical accomplishments&lt;br /&gt;
account as major achievements,&lt;br /&gt;
proving that a persons measure&lt;br /&gt;
is the legacy one leaves behind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
