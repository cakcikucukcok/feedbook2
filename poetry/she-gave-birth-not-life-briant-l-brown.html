  <title>She Gave Birth, Not Life - Briant L. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My words and my thoughts equal emotions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I wrote a poem, these three words were in my equation. I started writing poems in high school after finding a poetry book buried in a dresser drawer in my grandmother&#39;s home. The impact and emotions covered my body, and I wanted others to feel that same emotion through my words. This time it will be my vision and my writings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This journey started just like that buried poetry book. Instead of a book, there were buried relationships that would soon to be discovered. Those relationships of others impacted my emotions, therefore my writings. Some relationships were stronger than others and captured stronger emotions; those stories were easy to convey. I have left out names, a place, or race and revealed a story in a general aspect.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this book is a passionate journey through the beauty of relationships, love, pain, and most importantly, a reflection of all. We all have a story that we want to share through some form of art. In this book I hope to capture words, thoughts, and emotions that will share a message through my life experiences. In the end of it all, steal your hearts with words.&lt;/p&gt;" />
