  <title>When You Close Your Eyes: - Marvis Pharr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ive been writing for many years, usually short stories or journalistic pieces. Ive always enjoyed reading and writing.  My dad, Marvin, used to say: &quot;In order to write well, you need to read examples of good writing.&quot; My dad was an avid reader from comic books to spy novels. I too became an avid reader of comic books (Archies) and mysteries such as Trixie Belden, Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys. As a matter-of-fact, I still collect Nancy Drew Mystery novels. As I matured, I began reading novels like Maya Angelous: I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Dan Browns Da Vinci Code, Angel and Demons, Deception Point.
Ive always loved words, in any language; I especially love to juxtaposition words and phrases to express ideas, thoughts that conjure up images. 
Poetry came naturally. Literally, I sat down and started writing poetry to express how I felt: about a person, my feelings, my interactions with people, places, things. And before I knew it, I had a myriad of poems. 
Ive always read poetry, from Maya Angelou, to Langston Hughes, to Gwendolyn Brooks, Sonja Sanchez, Robert Frost, John Donne and Lord Byron.  But I never thought about writing poetry let alone compiling a collection of poems. 
So, why published now?  
Honestly, it started out as a way to give a part of me to my closets friends and then it snowballed from there. The more I thought about the more intrigued I became with self-publishing. I remember saying to my brother, Mark, I dont know were to begin and he responded: Begin with God. Tell him your hearts desires and he will lead the way. Let his light shine in you and you will become a light for hope and righteousness.
Wow! I never looked backed.
I went online and simply typed in self-publishing and stumbled across Xlibris Publishing Corp. I tossed around the idea and the possibility that this could actually happen for me and here I am  publishing my first book. 
The essence of this book is me  the part that no one ever sees. For those who think they know me, theyll read some of these poems, especially the love ones and say: I didnt think she had it in her; all of that bottled up passion. This book takes you to the deepest part of my soul  the part privy for God." />
