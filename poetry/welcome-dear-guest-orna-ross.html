      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Inspirational Poetry. Touches The Places Words Rarely Reach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Poetry: there are times in life when nothing else will do. At such times, you need a certain kind of poem, the kind of poems that are contained in Orna Ross&amp;#39;s poetry pamphlet series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The kind of poems that tell the truth about life while providing consolation and inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some of the things that are being said about this short book of inspirational poems:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;- &amp;quot;Reaches into the corners of your soul and pulls out all that is beautiful.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
- &amp;quot;Masterfully crafted poetry&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
- &amp;quot;These poems&amp;#39; many beauties are at the service of elusive truths.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
- &amp;quot;A little book of very big poems.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have never read poetry, this little pamphlet is a great place to start.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without ever straying into superficiality, Orna Ross&amp;#39;s poetry is compelling and accessible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are a poetry lover, then you&amp;#39;re sure to appreciate these poems about love, poems about life. poems about loss, and faith, and redemption &amp;mdash; all delivered in simple, yet achingly beautiful, words.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Poetry this powerful and profound is rarely so simple and compelling, which is why inspirational quotes from these poems are turning up all over the Internet, people drawn to their wise and uplifting insights.&lt;/b&gt;" />
