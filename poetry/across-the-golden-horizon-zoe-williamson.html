  <title>Across the Golden Horizon - Zoe Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the world of the surreal, I believe, there is a place where we all belong.
I love as does nature and natural beauty, like the throbbing heart beat among us, and when writing, unique and special people come alive to the song of the universe.
May you receive todays good fortunes with a happy heart, with unfailing determination to go even further.
Always take the risk and believe in such magnificent hope. Now I fly, continue forward.
Tomorrow will happen, no doubt, but right now the beauty has already begun.
Sometimes a writer drifts. In the absence of words creates paintings of the mystic, but everything is inspiration
I am a writer, I must create from what I see, I feel, I sense.
Perfection upon the everlasting moment of somewhere where impossible seemingly fits yet the moment our dreams become tangible is that time when possible is reachable. When your love is found allow yourself to bathe in the beauty of this love and begin the journey together. Sleep a journey of absolute possibility.
I take us now up higher and further and explore how our spiritual selves examine that and those we cannot understand on a daily basis.
Accepting the line of the horizon is definite and is drawn in curve by nature but is it impossible to cross? An artist can take a brush and paint however he sees the world, thereafter as can a musician create notes to accompany the place his inner self searches or a poet defining philosophy with words, yet best illustrated are the perceptions far beyond how we see as fathomable.
Let me take you further still, join me into the horizon." />
