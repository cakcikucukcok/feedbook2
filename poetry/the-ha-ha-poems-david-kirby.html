  <title>The Ha-ha: Poems - David Kirby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A feature of English landscape architecture, a ha-ha is a wall at the bottom of a ditch; its purpose is to allow the presence of cows and sheep on one&#39;s lawn, but at an agreeable distance and with none of the malodorous unsightliness that proximity would bring. Similarly, The Ha-Ha, the latest offering from poet David Kirby, is both an exploration of the ways in which the mind invites chaos yet keeps it at a distance and an apologia for humor, reflecting Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh&#39;s observation that tragedy is merely underdeveloped comedy. Embracing wit, wide-ranging scholarship, and an equal love of travel as well as the pleasures of home, The Ha-Ha depicts comedy as a radical form of intelligence, a way of thinking that just happens to be noisy and rumbustious.&lt;br&gt;We are staying with Barbara&#39;s parents on Oahu, and the first night we&#39;re there, I notice an angry-looking man is staring at me&lt;br&gt;out of the neighbor&#39;s upstairs window and mumbling something, but the second night I realize that it&#39;s that poster of Bo Diddley&lt;br&gt;from the famous Port Arthur concert, and there&#39;s a phone wirein front of his face that bobs up and down when the trade winds blow,&lt;br&gt;which they do constantly, making it seem as though Mr. Diddley is saying something to me.&lt;br&gt;From &quot;The Ha-Ha, Part I: The Tao of Bo Diddley&quot; published in The Ha-Ha: Poems by David Kirby.
