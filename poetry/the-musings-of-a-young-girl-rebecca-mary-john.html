  <title>The Musings of a Young Girl - Rebecca Mary John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book &#39;The Musings of a Young Girl&#39; is written by Rebecca Mary John, a young girl of 12 years. She was born in Kerala, India and did her early school education there. When she was seven years old she came to Dubai, UAE. Rebecca composing poems since the tender age of eight. Her poems are based on various topics and mostly related to her age .While going to school in her fathers car she noted things around her &amp; started discussing and conjuring poetry. Thus her early poems took concrete shape mostly while travelling. She used to jot down these lines on bits of paper and once she came back home she would put the finishing touches. The journey from the early poem Torn Shaun to The Cross depicts her progression as a poetess. The steady progress over the years is clearly seen in this book where her poems are displayed in the order of age (with the exception of the introductory poem A Poetess Journey.).Rebecca is also a meritorious student. Additionally, she is a voracious reader who also engages in coin collection, stamp collection and singing." />
