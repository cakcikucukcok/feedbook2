  <title>The Smell of Blood - K. Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It seems at least every generation the US has sent young men to war.  Although each one has its unique character they all take many young and less experienced men, and now women, and ask them to perform acts of violence only dimly hinted in movies and the media.  One thing all wars have in common is the government never prepares itself or their armed forces for the toll it takes on human beings and returning veterans, nor does it consider the impact of homecoming and transition these soldiers are expected to make.  Token parades or superficial and transient expressions of appreciation can in no way make up for the price we pay.  Many returning veterans have found release in writing, art, family and public service.  Many have never found their way home and some never will.  These are just some of one man&#39;s thoughts and feelings about his experience.  Although war is always big business, for those of us that fight it, it is personal." />
