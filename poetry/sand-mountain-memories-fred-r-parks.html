  <title>Sand Mountain Memories - Fred R. Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up in a small Kentucky town, my life was filled with happiness. With a big family and loving parents. as a teenager I started writing poems to show my love to my new bride. Later after the birth of our daughter I was overwhelmed with emotions and found myself writing more and more. 
it was after the passing of my Dad that I decided to try and get a book together. I felt I owed it to him as much as myself. With a church going family and a mom that loved telling stories it seemed only natural that I would want to write. 
I love remembering the past, people and places that I&#39;ve been, it&#39;s always been so easy for me to write them down. 
Sand Mountain Memories, was Thirty Years in the making. 
I now live in Mt Sterling Kentucky, Six miles from my childhood home and I often visit those wonderful hills that as a child I couldn&#39;t get enough of. 
In November of 2012 I was Diagnosed with Progressive MS and I thought now would be the time to get published... 
Thank You." />
