  <title>A Marked Peculiarity - Charles Bachman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Including traditional forms such as structured quatrain, sonnet, and terza rima, as well as free verse, these evocative, fresh and often outrageously humorous poems have a powerful and effective rhythm reflecting Bachman&#39;s background singing many leading roles in operas and musicals; their vividly metaphoric explorations of the great death-rebirth cycles of nature from delicate re-seeding of flowers to mountain crags and massive floes of ice on the Niagara River, reflect his love of both gardening and hiking/mountain climbing; his section on personal memories, including growing up in Iowa, express both tragedy and a gentle, kind humor for people he has known; and the many poems of fantasy and exploration of the bizarre corners of the psyche frequently shatter any safe, comfortable boundaries, leading the reader into strange, fascinating country reflecting Bachman&#39;s unique, highly unusual vision.  We have here a masterful, accomplished, highly individual poet at the peak of his powers who obviously believes the reader deserves vivid explorations, including fun and adventure--which this book provides in abundance." />
