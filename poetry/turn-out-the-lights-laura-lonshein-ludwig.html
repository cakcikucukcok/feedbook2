  <title>Turn out the Lights - Laura Lonshein Ludwig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It can happen again, a new wave of movies that are as good as the classics of the Golden and Silver age. This is a book of stories that will captivate you from the 1700s to the twenty-first century and beyond our time to escape into and yet wish to read again and again. Scene descriptions that are exquisite to the eye beckon you to follow the unforgettable characters from love found after World War One for those just entering middle age, to a current-day private detective story where an attractive woman who is fifty years old is rescued from a deceptive man who is stealing her jewels and money while attempting to convince her of the security and love he will offer her in marriage.
Plays and short stories for the screen and stage for the many talented actors, producers and directors seeking material that offers interesting dialogue, passionate, intelligent, with the depth and character, and philosophical nature that allows the actor to live in the minds of the audience for decades.
Mysteries, love stories, and comedies can be found in this book. A classic comedy, The Man on the Street Is Without a Prayer, is includeda screenplay, that Richard Ornstein, cohost of The Joe Franklin Memory Lane radio show, reviewed with other work from her first book, Robo Sapiens.
I read Laura Lonshein Ludwigs poetry, screenplays, and short stories. She is incredible and so good that I collaborated with her on a screenplay with Joe Franklin, The Desk. Laura has a great imagination, terrific wit. Laura is my definition of Mel Brooks. She is genius.
The Desk will appear in another book or in a film. The Man on the Street Is Without a Prayer has been compared to Duck Soup in its possibilities by legends in the arts. A second science fiction screenplay, a light comedy is included in this collection. For those who love to read good literature, this book will give you hours of delight. Poetry is included as well as other short stories. Laura is a well-published writer and worked on two literary magazines, The New Press Literary Review and Medicinal Purposes, and is listed in Whos Who in the World as a screenwriter, director for TV and radio, poet, and actress. The first few pages of the book offers other reviews for previous work by Laura. This book, with the exception of The Man on the Street Is Without a Prayer, has work that has never been published before." />
