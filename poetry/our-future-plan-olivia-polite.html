  <title>Our Future Plan - Olivia Polite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I thank the LORD my GOD for each one of these poetry.
I give him all of the HONOR and GLORY. He has been
My all and all, he has given me a second chance at LIFE
that is why, I&#39;m thankful and gracious for making any
SACRIFICE.
I never ever thought about writing Poetry, but being
HUMBLE and OBEDIENT, I&#39;m doing GOD WILL
In my Life Joyfully.
No matter what time of Day or Night when I hear
The LORD speak to me, I then put everything to
The side and start to write.
My true desire is Worshipping the LORD with all
My Health and Strength as GOD Bless me
SPIRITUALLY, while feeding my SOUL
Daily I receive my WISDOM and KNOWLEDGE
Through his HOLY WORD peacefully.
As GOD delivered me from my worldly life of SIN.
The he freely poured out his LOVE upon me
Through his GRACE and MERCY, no one or
Nothing can ever take his place.
My LORD and SAVIOR brought me through
In a VICTORIOUS way. That is why no matter
Whatever happen he deserve from me all of his
HONOR, GLORY, and PRAISE.
I&#39;m now CONFIDENT to say that the words that
He place within my MIND and HEART, will
Be an encouragement to someone to receive
A chance for a BRAND NEW START." />
