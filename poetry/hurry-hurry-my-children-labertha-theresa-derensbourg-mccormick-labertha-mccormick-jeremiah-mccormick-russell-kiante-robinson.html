  <title>Hurry! Hurry My Children - Labertha Theresa Derensbourg-McCormick, Labertha McCormick, Jeremiah McCormick, Russell Kiante Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hopefully, Ive given an array of hope without some doubtful era of your lifes existence as you juggle through its predicaments. May you be given light to any or some of your lifes circumstances, dilemmas or situations. One of the primary purposes of my writing is not to show you my play with words but to solely promote healing in some way. 
Although a number of my poems written dont directly relate to the title, Hurry, Hurry, My Children, some urgency of each piece written can be readily applied to the readers thought pattern. Thus being so, the actual poem Hurry, Hurry, My Children is a beckoning to the reader to prepare and make haste. I believe that as surely as this world had a beginning, it will have an ending. My mission is to make an attempt to prepare you for the Great Transformation.
Inadvertently, the seriousness of those poems related to the title is somewhat tangled with a spark of humor. Given credence to the biblical scripture, Blessed be the merry heart, within my writings humor is easily applied, sometimes unknowingly. 
1 Thessalonians 3:13: To the end he may stablish your  hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints" />
