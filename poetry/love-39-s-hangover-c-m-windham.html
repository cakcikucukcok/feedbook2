  <title>Love&#39;s Hangover - C.M. Windham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A labor of love, this collection of poems takes the reader on a journey from the negative emotions felt within bad relationships to the inner thoughts of a woman surviving domestic violence and sexual assault. Witness the triumph of an unbroken spirit and the evolution of a young woman who goes from being a child in an abusive home, to becoming the abused mom.  Readers are also invited to detail any of their own thoughts, goals and dreams in the journal section of the book.  Message from the author:  &quot;Writing is therapeutic as it allows one to release emotions that may otherwise be repressed.  In the journal section I implore you to write down some of the negative things you have been told about yourself, as well as the good things that you know to true.  Then go back to what you have written when you feel discouraged to remind yourself that the labels placed on you by society are in no way an indication of who and what you are.  Encourage yourself, kick down walls, break glass ceilings and prove the naysayers wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
