  <title>Victory - Darryl Hale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My husband, Pastor Darryl Hale passed away May 2007, but his legacy continues in
countless ways. I am honored to present his poems to you for the purpose of your 
inspiration, edification and increased hope and faith in God. My desire is for you to
know and follow God more fully, and sincerely, as you read from a remarkably gifted 
man who truly personified a Christian. Seconds before my husband lapsed into non-
responsiveness, I glimpsed him as the nurse was gently washing him, I noticed that he 
was bone-thin and his skin had taken on a yellowish pallor. Yet he sat on a chair,
quietly and calmly talking to the nurse about the goodness of Jesus, as she in turn 
quietly responded and affirmed this, as she continued his care. When I came in, I 
suddenly felt the need to do something; to get darryl demoting he had been asking 
earlier during the week. In a fateful decision, I turned heel and left with the purpose of 
going to the gift store and returning with the small item; by then I reasoned, the nurse 
would be done and I could talk to Darryl and basically have him to myself. This was not 
to be. My husband died moments after I left his room. This is what comforts me; that 
Darryls last moments on earth were spend talking about Christ to one more should with 
his last breath of life.
