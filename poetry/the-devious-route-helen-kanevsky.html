  <title>The Devious Route - Helen Kanevsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We often judge remarkable achievements by the rarity in which they are performed. It
is no exaggeration to place that judgment on these provocative poems by Helen Kanevsky. These
writings are something special and rare, from a poet who only began to learn English as an older
adultbringing into her new-lettered world the life experience of a native to Russian Jewish culture,
with its deep literary tradition intertwined with the complex history of a country that not so long ago
stood at the crossroads of world events and the forefront of social revolution.
Reading these poems by Helen Kanevsky makes me think of the power of words  the
power to evoke, the power to lead the mind through new avenues of hitherto unknown realities.
Helen is very conscious of this power and rejoices in their potential when she proclaims her adamant
faith in the superpower of words.
Helen has emerged as a new person, in a new world. And it occurs to me that the words
have formed the woman as much as the woman has formed the words. There is in this a gift to the
reader: As a foreigner brought on to the shores of English expression, she brings a unique framework.
As she directs her verbal lens we see the world in a different way.
