  <title>Lycoris Radiata - Tenzin Nyidon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book Lycoris Radiata is a poetry book. Book filled with emotions and experience. It is a journey of how the feelings and emotions within oneself leave you for the better or worse of you. Happiness, sadness, anger, hatred, and many more within ourselves, which we dare not express, have been expressed for you. Lycoris radiata, or the red spider lily, is a flower that blooms during late summer or autumn, often in response to heavy rainfall.
Some legends have it that when you see someone that you might never meet again, these flowers would bloom along the path. Just like that, once the poems are jotted down on paper, they become their own selves, leaving behind the one who wrote them to never be met again." />
