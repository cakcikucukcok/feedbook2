  <title>Book of Styx - Eddy Styx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Book of Styx is a collection of dark poetry in the setting of howling winds and eerie landscapes. The art comes from the murky imagination of Eddy Styx. Eddy Styx is the male, murderous, alter ego of C.M. Mattison. He has a flare for murder, mayhem, madness and poetry. His poetry will take you to a different world of shadowy reality within the dank, gloomy alleyways of his mind; his reality, where ghosts still walk and the dead have voice and speak, not always in whispers. He invites the reader to enter into this grim world, all of which is in his fevered mind. He is quick-witted and deadly accurate with his switchblade knife. When he takes on the project of murder, there is none like him in dedication. He is a modern day Jack the Ripper. His poetry explores the delicate balance between life and death. With a deft mind, he will take the reader on a macabre journey of a lifetime." />
