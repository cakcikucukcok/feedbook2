  <title>Like Pages of a Diary - April N. Royal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like Pages of a Diary, consists of poems that speak on love, pain, inspiration, peace, issues we face everyday, and gaining understanding of life.  This work is a collection of thoughts that the mind and heart thinks, but the mouth does not always speak.  This book is the voice of the speechless and hidden.  It reaches out to those who feel lost, confused, happy or proud.  Within the pages, the spirit of all people, not just African American women, but all women, men, and young adults, can find themselves and/or find something they can relate to, they can say this is their personal story or thoughts that passed through them. 
This book of poetry is not written to offend, depress or degrade any sex, creed or race of people, but to up lift, motivate and strengthen the knowledge of society.  I would like to think there is a poem that can capture each reader and brings a new understanding, not just about life, but also about oneself.   
This poetry, as my eyes see it, is the light that shines on the world, bringing us from darkness.  Poetry is the root of peace and a calmness that over flows into our lives daily.
Poetry reminds us of reality, and the fact that nothing in life, or in us, is perfect.
This book of poetry represents me, what I stand for, strive for, see and feel, as well as what others have taken in during the span of their lives-April" />
