  <title>Straight from the Heart - Rosemarie Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is, in a way, a biography of my life&#39;s experiences. I always had trouble expressing my feelings verbally about good times and bad, so I started to write them down on paper. I found that it was easier to express how I felt about things that had happened to me when I wrote them down. Life has a way of throwing you a lot of cures on your journey through it, good ones and bad, and my poetry was a way of me excepting them. I found with every curve life threw at me, there was a lesson to be learned. When you deal with the experience, you can move on with your life and become a better person. Life is too short to dwell in the past and let things get you down. You should enjoy life to the fullest, and with every feeling and emotion you handle through, your experiences makes you a better person. This was my way of moving on with my life and looking for a brighter future." />
