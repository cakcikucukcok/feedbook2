  <title>An Indignant Denial - Nasir Jalal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Autumn Green
(March 18, 2008)
Merciless Northerly winds appear,
heralding me as if my end is near.
Still I hold on to linger
life, sucked out, for it is finally winter.
Hoping though, wishing to live another day,
for a warm wind might help me sway.
You were life, my friend,
how could you blend
friendship with cold, cold revenge?
Come now, let me clutch thee,
help me save myself, and let me see
the light of yet another day.
Alright, she says,
since you have been a friend to me,
but light is all you shall see.
This compassion and grace
is all I seek from a friend in haste;
dawn shall never be a hope again,
I knew, I think all hope was in vain.
There it was, beautiful as ever,
the life itself, the shine of endeavor.
As I cherished the rising sun for one last time,
she moved in fast. As if it was crime?
Took me by the arm to make me flow,
snapped hard, so I would let go;
and then she swayed me away
in her arms, I took my last breath.
Emotionless, she looked and said,
your time you have fully spent,
make room now, for others to be content." />
