  <title>On the Mountain of Light - Al Hajji Robert J. Rowland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book of songs and poetry, is a look at the world we live in.  Love, Religion, Politics, Mental Awareness and Controversy of day to day life.  As human beings embark on the 21st century, there will be some challenging times ahead.  But we are in control of our planet, and each one of us is responsible for the impact that will change our world.  Whether good, bad, happy or sad, your state of being will be very important to the contributions you will make.  Diamonds wars and diamond deaths, when will they stop.  
Oil wars or keeping terrorist under control in the middle east must stop.  We still have no cures for Aids and Cancer.  Oil producer and production are on a greedy path of taking money out of our pockets. Alternative fuels and their production are a immediate need in our world. Let us hope the next generations of our political leaders, will hear the peoples voice and not the lobbyist fueling millions of dollars in their campaign funds.  Love is the key to our world survival, everyone should take a trip  On The Mountain Of Light.
