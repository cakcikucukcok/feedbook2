  <title>From an Officer&#39;s Wife - Claudine Barbot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Claudine Barbot has been writing poetry nearly all of her life. When her former husband joined the police force in 2005, it was no surprise that she began detailing various aspects of the job in her poetry. From this was born &quot;From an Officer&#39;s Wife,&quot; which discusses the joys, challenges, and encounters of police officers and their families on a day to day basis.
In this heartfelt book, she recounts the typical experiences of a police officer through her own eyes. She approaches the book with various elements, taking into account common reactions from citizens, officers, their families, and those who make the decisions as well. She also taps into her life with her former husband, as she opens up from a wife&#39;s perspective, reliving her fears, violent encounters, and the ruins that she and her family faced as a result of the experiences that he encountered on the job.
From an Officers Wife tackles a wide range of topics often left untouched or swept under the rug in the police community, soliciting a variety of emotions from pain, anger, happiness, fear, and sadness. This book will touch the hearts of many and has something for anyone who has ever had a personal relationship with a law enforcement officer." />
