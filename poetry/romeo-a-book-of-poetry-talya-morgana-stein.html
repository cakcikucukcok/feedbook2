  <title>Romeo: A Book of Poetry - Talya Morgana Stein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is it about the love that got away, that ended due to circumstances or timing, that draws our imagination and sparks our hopes and dreams?   Romeo: A Book of Poetry shares verses considering that lost love with passion, anger, and regret for what could have been. Maybe it occurred in a moment when one partner or the other wasn&#39;t quite ready to receive the level of love offered up. Lost love never leaves; instead, it stays with you forever, through the ups and downs and back and forth of emotion that results from its departure. As our minds wander, what is left is the residual hope, the possibility, the thing that keeps us afloat, asking, &quot;Does true love ever die?&quot;   This collection of poetry explores the emotions that arise in response to the end of a relationship and the loss of love and connection that goes with it." />
