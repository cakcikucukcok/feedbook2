&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Path to a Kingdom
I dont know where to go
Im just a child with no home
I have to fight this alone
and my soul feels so cold
Darkness always blankets my rose
Apart and never felt a whole
Promises, they get lost in old
Opportunities are stops that are closed
Im to be open to all roads
These helpless hands only to fold
The day I rest it will snow
Answers the ground will know
How much farther down is low
When dads lye decomposed
Only faith guides me through this storm
I find resistance wherever I roam
One day I will find my home
She is a heaven of my own&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" />
