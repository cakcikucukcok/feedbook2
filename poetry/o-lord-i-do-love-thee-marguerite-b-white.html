  <title>O Lord I Do Love Thee - Marguerite B. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was only a few years ago, God shed his light on me. Anointed me with the gift of writing poetry. He opened my eyes to understand from the scripture that I read. A powerful message came down from above and descended here on me. The grace of God bestowed on me, the special gift that was given. Burns in my soul, lets the words flow on this paper it is written. O may I thank him daily for what he has given to me. May my heart yearn to do his will, to use this gift he placed in me. To see the mighty hand of God, the creator of all things. Who used a humble servant, made her a child of the King!" />
