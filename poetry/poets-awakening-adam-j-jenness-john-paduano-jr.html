  <title>Poets Awakening - Adam J Jenness, John Paduano Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The man had been walking through the barren tundra in the midst of
a howling blizzard for an eternity it seemed, looking back behind him
the furry of the storm had left no trace of the path he had already
painfully trod. His mind screamed for a warmth not to be found,
knowing his only chance for survival was to keep moving forward,
he slowly trudged on into the icy teeth of hells frozen maw. Blowing
great plumes of laboring breath that left his face covered with a
stinging icy sheen, he plunged forward on legs of stone, his vision
started to blur by the sheer force of his efforts. This was a battle no
man could win. His mind started to reel with an agonizing pain as
death started to close in its icy grip. Trying to will himself past the
threshold of mortal man he managed just a few more faltering steps
before his frozen body fell to the ground slipping into the sweet black
oblivion. Feeling a sudden sharp pain he moaned helplessly feeling
himself being slowly lifted into the heavens, before the final crushing
embrace a voice pierced the darkness uttering but one single word
Forgiveness. His last vision that of the world slowly gliding by." />
