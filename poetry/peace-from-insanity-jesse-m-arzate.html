  <title>Peace from Insanity - Jesse M. Arzate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are oceans between us.
Not those that divide lands,
but those that divide us
with powerful emotions.
Jesse Arzate
Jesse Arzate knows life is an interesting journey full of twists and turns, ups and downs, and black and white moments that are sometimes unclear. Inspired by his desire to know more, he has developed a passion for encouraging others to observe humanity and then do what they can to live within a peaceful world. 
In a collection of free verse, tArzate explores the sane and insane moments we all experience at one time or another in our lives. His poems reflect on how the colors on a canvas can create a masterpiece but yet the colors of a skin can create racism, why power and money in the hands of some is like matches in the hands of an arsonist, why faith is deceiving to the heart, and whether it is possible to live within a world of kindness and forgiveness.
Peace from Insanity shares poetry that inspires all of us to look both outward at humanity and within ourselves for the answers on how to attain peace in a chaotic world." />
