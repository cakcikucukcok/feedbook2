  <title>“Take a Thought . . . Wholesome and Good.” - Larry Troxel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Plutarch said, Painting is silent poetry and poetry is painting that speaks. I am pleased when I can so &quot;speak&quot; with others being favorable to what Ive said, including the following: 
I purchased Larry Troxel&#39;s poetry book and enjoyed it so much that I made it a gift to a special little lady. It is well written and she loves it being read to her. Jean B., Oklahoma. 
Larry&#39;s poetry is mind-opening . . . he is a poet who captures the imagination of his readers and accelerates insight. Ray G., California. 
An extremely talented poet, Larry&#39;s writings bring back yonder years in a way that only he can do, and his wisdom shows us a deep sensitivity that brings peace to one&#39;s soul. Meg G., Tennessee
I always look forward to Larry Troxel&#39;s poems. His writing style and use of words make it easy to visualize the entire story his poems are telling. Each poem is unique and one may be left with a smile, a tear, happy memories from the past or a good life lesson. Marian O., Oregon
And a literary review: 
I must say that you have a talent for poetry writing, which is no small feat. An important aspect of poetry is attention to concrete detail. You certainly have a knack for this! You write with such beautiful, condensed language. It affects emotion and thought on multiple levels through your use of symbol and imagery. You make it easy for your reader to identify with your words. It is always easy to tell when an author spends time with their writing. I have to say that it is obvious that you have done a significant amount planning and preparation in crafting your work. You truly have crafted another excellent piece. Bravo! Linda C., Colorado" />
