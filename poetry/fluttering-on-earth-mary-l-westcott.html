  <title>Fluttering on Earth - Mary L. Westcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of poetry originated many years ago when I wrote about my relationships with several active alcoholics. I use the image of the butterfly because these creatures are among the most beautiful in the world, and I attach spiritual significance to them. In poetry, butterflies often represent freedom, whimsy, or transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started writing poetry about twenty-five years ago when I needed an avocation other than my career in public health. Since that time, I have undergone a spiritual change through twelve-step programs, Unity teachings, A Course in Miracles, meditation, and writing. The metamorphosis and the poems that accompanied this change are chronicled here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of the collection consists of a poem on one page and an affirmation with a statement about the poem on the page following in order to enhance understanding of the poem. I have found that affirmations are useful tools for turning around negative thoughts. The poems are arranged in order from darker themes to lighter, more spiritual themes. This collection can help others overcome the difficulty of a relationship with a non-recovering alcoholic or other addicted person. There are many paths to recovery that offer hope for dealing with the most challenging of relationships. This is one of those paths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
