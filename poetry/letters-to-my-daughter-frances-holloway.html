  <title>Letters to My Daughter - Frances Holloway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book came about when my only daughter passed away in the early
morning of Easter Sunday 2013. She had cancer. She was doing very well.
The day before she passed, on Saturday, she and her loving husband had
gone to do some shopping. They ate dinner, watched a movie, and went
to bed around 10:00 p.m. or so. Her husband found her about 4:00 a.m.,
hanging over the bathtub. She was gone. That was the darkest day of my
life. She was only forty-four years old and a new grandmother. She loved
her babies and her husband. She is dearly missed." />
