  <title>The Christian Writer&#39;s Coach: How to Get the Most out of a Writers Conference - Northwest Christian Writer&#39;s Association</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Christian Writer&#39;s Coach: How to Get the Most Out of a Writers Conference is the first in a series of books specially designed by Northwest Christian Writers Association writers. In this book you will find best-practices and tools for your tool belt to help you succeed as a writer.   First, with five bios of successful people in the industry, we learn from the experts.  After the bios, the book is divided into three parts:   • Before a conference • During a conference • After a conference   In each section, you&#39;ll find innovative ways to be prepared and put your best foot forward. The best part of this book is the depth of resources. In each chapter, you will find links from experts throughout the industry. This a fun and interactive research tool.  God created you for a purpose, and he gifted you with the ability to use words to inspire others and to shape culture. It is our prayer that as you read this book, you will find new tools that will alleviate the mystery of publishing and help you fulfill the dream you were called to.
