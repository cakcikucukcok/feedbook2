  <title>You Don&#39;t Need a Bodhi Tree - Tess Marcin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Whatever it takes!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not everyone knows about the bodhi tree and Buddha...more people know about Newton and his tree.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However. . . there is no denying that both Buddha and Newton were enlightened, that they found insight.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book urges the reader to seek enlightenment, to seek insight, but not by sitting under any special tree. The reader can sit anywhere because the place he will find what he is looking for is within the self.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Throughout the history of man he has ever been on the move. Like Diogenes with his lantern in search of an honest man, historical man has been searching for insight, for enlightenment about . . . self.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many words have been written, many doors have been opened, but the one door, the one where all the answers lie, has been the most stubborn.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Humanity; educated man, confused man, where has life led him? Up and down some strange paths, in and out of some strange doors. Man prides himself on how he has managed his time on this planet. Man has overlooked the most important facet. . . He has not kept uppermost in his life the one thought that is most insightful. Man, the human, travels in cycles. In the cycle of human time he learns the lessons, he experiences life. Within the circle of eternality, in the life of no time, he, either atones for his errors in judgment, or he continues to build on his good judgment, as spirit.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Humanity, man vs spirit, life vs life, intertwined for all eternity.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The journey awaits us no matter which side of the threshold we find ourselves on, because we live. The we, the us, the I, the me, the self. No one has ever seen the image behind these words, but it is there.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While here, living this life in the physical we make daily choices. We really make choices in the passing of each second. We make good choices, we make bad choices. They are our choices, we are the creators of the thought that gives action to these choices. And yet . . . The human has the nasty habit of denying the responsibility of the action of choice. Good choice . . . Pat on the back. Bad choice . . . Someone else made him do it. Ego never rests, it is always front and center.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Man has been gifted with creativity. He astounds himself by his inventiveness, but too many times he does not give credit where credit is due. Too many deny the existence of the One who gave them life. Too many believe that out of nowhere they arrived fully gifted by their own efforts. Out of the slime, the human crawled forth in all his creative glory, in all the glory of his many mysterious parts. Now that is ego riding high.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The book may zig, it may zag, it may step off the path, it may take a side path, but it is only imitating the progress of life. Each zig, each zag, each step, has a tendency to pick up a nugget of thought. Thoughts leap from one to the next, linger a moment and its on to the next one. Mind, and spirit, metaphysics, life, self, wisdom and knowledge, space, universe, the future, light, insight, enlightenment, etc. All represented in this book by the thoughts of the writer. 
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One can only hope that the reader finds his insight, his enlightenment, expanding, growing, as he reads the book. That he finds his thoughts creating a perspective uniquely his own.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One can also say that the stream of conscience that created:
&lt;P&gt;YOU DONT NEED A BODHI TREE
&lt;P&gt;is more than just capricious.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We travel different paths, but eventually we all arrive at our destination, the only destination there is for us, a oneness with our Creator.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enjoy!!&lt;/P&gt;" />
