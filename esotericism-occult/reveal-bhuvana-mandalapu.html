  <title>Reveal - Bhuvana Mandalapu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What makes someone successful? Throughout our lives we may find that any number of things can hold us back; tragedy, grief, financial difficulties, and fear are just some of the reasons we choose not to go after our dreams. We look at those who become greatmen like Steve Jobs and women like J.K. Rowlingand wonder at their great lives. Even so, these people have faced problems of their own and overcome them. What is it within them that makes the difference? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, author and neurologist Bhuvana Mandalapu advocates the constant practice of basic concepts such as dont give up, let it go, and moderation. Living by these rules helps us take advantage of the neuroplasticity of our minds in order to train ourselves to become successful. This consistent practice teaches us to accept our faults and shortcomings in order to bring them into harmony with our strengths and abilities. Simultaneously, as we continue this consistent practice, we can achieve harmony between our conscious and subconscious minds, resulting in a kind of super-consciousness that can help us dominate adversity and achieve even our most incredible goals. &lt;/p&gt;" />
