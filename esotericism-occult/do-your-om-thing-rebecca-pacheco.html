  <title>Do Your Om Thing - Rebecca Pacheco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Yoga, Meet Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes an hour-long yoga class is the only chance we get to connect meaningfully with our bodies and our minds during a week otherwise full of work, family, and the daily grind. Have you ever wondered how would it feel to bring that experience of awareness and calm out of the yoga studio and into your everyday life? After all, we know that practicing yoga can give us a leaner body and more sculpted limbs, but isn&#39;t its most important benefit the way it makes us &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Do Your Om Thing&lt;/em&gt;, master yoga teacher and creator of the popular blog OmGal.com Rebecca Pacheco shows us that the true practice of yoga is about much more than achieving the perfect headstand or withstanding an hour-long class in a room heated to 100 degrees. &quot;Yoga is not about performance,&quot; she tells us, &quot;it&#39;s about practice, on your mat and in your life. If you want to get better at anything what should you do? &lt;em&gt;Practice.&lt;/em&gt; Confidence, compassion, awareness, joy&amp;#8212;if you want more of these&amp;#8212;and who doesn&#39;t?&amp;#8212;yoga offers the skills to practice them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her warm, personal, and often hilarious prose, Rebecca translates yogic philosophy for its twenty-first-century devotees, making ancient principles and philosophy feel accessible, relatable, and genuinely rooted in the world in which we live today. And by illuminating how the guiding principles of yoga apply to our modern lives, Rebecca shows us that the true power of a yoga practice is not physical transformation, but mental and spiritual liberation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
