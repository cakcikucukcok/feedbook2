Tammy&#39;s intricately woven daily guidance melds an understanding of life&#39;s trials and tribulations with the higher vantage point that every moment is progressive and purposeful. When you absorb the deep, yet practical advice in &quot;Channeling Ezekiel&quot; then, and only then, will you move forward on your intentional journey. 
Dr. Linda R. Backman, Psychologist/Regression Therapist Author of: &quot;Bringing Your Soul to Light: Healing through Past Lives and the Time Between&quot;  www.RavenHeartCenter.com
A Daily Guide is a powerful and direct tool that really helped me keep a positive focus through my transition to self-employment. The messages are compassionate and inspiring! Its clear that a very wise and loving being is being channeled to support our journey and bring out the BEST in all of us. I really love reading the guidance and it words really resonate with the empowered person I am becoming. Thank you so much to Tammy for delivering this work!~Carolyn Tryhurn, Soul Clarity Hypnotherapy, Calgary (www.SoulClarity.ca)" />
