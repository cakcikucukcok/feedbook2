  <title>The Butterfly Fields - Carole Vickie Pilcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Believe, believe in your heart that you are truly free then so it shall be.
Life presents us with many gifts, some are wonderful, others more challenging. But each gift we recieve holds something valuable, a lesson. Something that will help us to grow and move us forward sometimes with faltering steps other times with joy in our heart.
Join Carole on her journey as she travels through many trials and tribulations that arise from dealing with circumstances that life can bring and the emotional turmoil within, learning that our true Spiritual Pathway however difficult is unfolding just as it should.
Taking us upon our own inner journey, a road to true Spiritual enlightenment and realization that love and forgiveness from within can create peace and harmony in our ever changing world.
&quot;.........At times we just want empathy. Yet even more, we want sympathy. Yes, we want to have the reassurance that the experiences, no matter how painful or possibly pleasurable, are ok. We want to be sure that there is another human being who has gone through that and at the end of those events, has become even better, happier and richer.&quot; OLGA LEVANCUKA" />
