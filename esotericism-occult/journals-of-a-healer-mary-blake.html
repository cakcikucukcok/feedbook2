  <title>Journals of a Healer - Mary Blake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What would you do with a round-trip ticket to travel through time? What if you could&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Re-write History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Learn from their mistakes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Eliminate hidden barriers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Break free from karmic patterns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-life Therapy is a safe, easy way to do all that and more! This book chronicles real peoples visits with other incarnations and their transformative results. Marys fluid, engaging style transports you to Atlantis, Egypt, Nazi Germany and even other galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each encounter with emotional turmoil and unresolved conflicts carried forward from other lifetimes bears gifts of enlightenment and triumph on many levels. Marys pioneer work with Multi Life Therapy delicately taps the resonating core of consciousness to reveal the interconnections of karmic history, current reality and future potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we have past lives? &lt;i&gt;Journals of a Healer&lt;/i&gt; goes far beyond that question to affirm past-life regression and document the unlimited ways it can heal. Anyone seeking to understand themselves will benefit from this extraordinary book, which brings to light story after remarkable story of past lives. In it, &lt;b&gt;Mary Blake&lt;/b&gt; takes us on a guided tour of healing through the power of Spirit and universal love. Through her work, she has helped countless people find greater peace in this lifetimeand she has helped them rewrite history, expanding love for the ages. - Debra Engle, publisher, editor, coach and author of &lt;i&gt;Grace from the Garden: Changing the World One Garden at a Time&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mary Blake&lt;/b&gt; is one of the wisest women I know. I deeply value her as a member of my spiritual family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilene Kristen, actress, director, producer, singer, songwriter, New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary is a trailblazer who has helped countless people in so many ways. She is my teacher, healer, spiritual coach, and good friend, and has opened me to my own incredible path as an intuitive healer. I am eternally grateful for all Ive gained from her wise counsel, intuitive insights, and encounters together in the realms f multi-dimensional consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Gottlieb, CNHP (Certified Natural Health Professional), Intuitive Empowerment Coach, Energy Psychology Specialist, Master Hypnotist, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing lifetime I visited with Mary was the most life-changing spiritual experience of my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
