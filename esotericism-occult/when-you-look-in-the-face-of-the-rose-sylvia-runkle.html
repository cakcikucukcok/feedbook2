  <title>When You Look in the Face of the Rose - Sylvia Runkle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This channeled writing is the first of four books channeled through Sylvia Runkle by a Spirtit Guide identified as Jonathan.  However, the channeling seems to come from a group more than from a single entitiy.
The book revolves around Sylvias first two of four training trips to Russia in the mid 90s, but are not really about these trips.  The essence of the message seems to be about raising the vibrational level of the people of Earth as well as of the Earth itself. In Book 4 we read Earth must raise vibration level, must entrain in one direction.  When the vibrations reach a critical mass, Mankind can make the shift into its next reality.
The message is at the same time spiritual and practical in a day to day way.  The reader is actually listening in to a message directed to Sylvia.  The beginning is a somewhat awkward as Sylvia feels her way into receiving the message.  In fact the book ebbs and flows as the connection is stronger or weaker.  The awkward parts have been left in to allow an aspiring channeler to get a sense of how it happens.  And they are well made up for where the message flows.
Sylvias small personal drama mentioned in Book 1, (Will the anticipated, but not confirmed, first trip to Russia actually occur?) is amusingly resolved early in the second book.   The channeling ends (at the end of Book 4) as she writes on the plane returning from the second training she presented in Russia.  These trips add background, but the message transcends the setting.
The channeled writing comes as a rhythm.  Each days writing begins with short phrases written as verse as the channeler blends with those coming through, and then switches to a rhythmic prose.  The rhythm seems to be an important part of the message and they often encourage saying certain words aloud, such as peace, home and love.  The words and the rhythm seem somehow to blend to affect the vibrations of the reader." />
