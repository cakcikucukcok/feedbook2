      <meta name="description" content="Ever ask y ourself how big space is? Or how long time will go on? Or maybe you want to know what is waiting for us after our suns dies and our galaxy turns into nothing but a black hole in space? May be you wonder what ghosts are and where aliens come from? Or you &quot;just seem to have knowledge&quot; of something you&#39;ve never studied. Or maybe you have had a lot of deja Vu moments 
and you don&#39;t know why. 
How old are we explores all these questions and events to help you understand life, time and space in an easy to read book. Shirley is a student of the Universe and looks at all these subjects from a clairvoyant side. She views many things as metaphors supplied by the Universe to help us learn lessons the easy way, if we just look at them in a non-judgmental way.
How Old are We shows us how clear life can be when you take the time to step off the stage see what is really going on in our life." />
