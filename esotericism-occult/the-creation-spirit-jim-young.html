  <title>The Creation Spirit - Jim Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;THE CREATION SPIRIT; Expressing Your Divinity in Everyday Life &lt;/I&gt; is a story of the Holy Spirit told through the voice of  Christo Sahbays, an itinerant metaphysician from northwest Arkansas who is gathering popularity as a mediator for a spirituality of living the Truth of our being.   This initial entry in the author&#39;s new &lt;I&gt;MY SPIRITUAL AWARENESS SERIES&lt;/I&gt; features metaphorical translations of parables and holy Scripture to enlighten, inspiring followers to heal themselves by first healing their perspectives on life.  As a master metaphysician, Christo shakes the foundation upon which most have constructed their personal mythology of religious doctrine.  He then leads them to a sense of Oneness that focuses their house of consciousness toward those inner whispers of Truth rather than on the illusions of outward authorities that often lead to a purposeless, unfulfilled life. &lt;p&gt; 
Building on this first offering, other writings that continue the &lt;I&gt;MY SPIRITUAL AWARENESS SERIES&lt;/I&gt; are&lt;I&gt; A LABOR OF LOVE; Weaving Your Own Virgin Birth on the Loom of Life&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;KEYS TO THE DOOR OF TRUTH; Metaphysical Musings of a Born-Yet-Again&lt;/I&gt;.  Other books in process deal with such topics as the metaphysical meaning of Jesus and his disciples, the Sermon on the Mount, some of the various &quot;newfound&quot; Gospels, and those portions of the remaining three Gospels that do not replicate the content of the Gospel of John--all placed in a practical perspective." />
