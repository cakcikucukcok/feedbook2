  <title>Steps Along the Way - Linda Lucas Walling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some people experience healing miracles and are suddenly transformed. Others, like me, set out on the path putting one foot after the other, sometimes finding a smooth highway, other times finding the path treacherous. I believe miracles can happen to anyone, and I welcome the time when I allow myself to experience mine. In the meantime, I take my steps and celebrate the way stations and landmarks as I reach them. I have mild cerebral palsy affecting my left side. The necessary spiritual healing that is the subject of these poems may or may not have been triggered by cerebral palsy, but CP has had a strong influence on my life. I have carried much emotional baggage because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These poems are not about seeking and arriving at a final destination. Instead they are about the segment of my journey during which I learned to trust the loving support and guidance that was always available for me. Its available for us all, of course. That was part of my discovery. Discovering the balance of mind, body, and spirit continues into the future. Thats the nature of the Way!&lt;/p&gt;" />
