  <title>Stars on the Earth - Richard Leviton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Discover the wonderful secret the Earth holds for us-that the stars of the galaxy live on our planet.
&lt;p&gt;
Holograms of high-magnitude stars over holy mountains. Physical travel to other planets through stargates on the Earth&#39;s surface. Near instantaneous transportation across the planet through quick-way portals. &lt;p&gt;
Outrageous science fiction or sober geomantic fact?&lt;p&gt;
Earth Mysteries researcher Richard Leviton takes you on a wild tour of three geomantic features of our planet and reveals that what science fiction has dreamed the Earth in fact offers us. &lt;i&gt;Stars on the Earth&lt;/i&gt; combines scholarship, clairvoyance, and field experience with the latest discoveries of geology and astrophysics and the timeless insights of the world&#39;s myths to open the planetary door to the stars.&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s all part of the Earth&#39;s unsuspected but staggeringly rich endowment as a designer planet. Our planet was precisely designed and implemented for us, and it&#39;s equipped with a visionary geography that mirrors features of the galaxy and Heavens.&lt;p&gt;
Why are so many of the Earth&#39;s mountains said to be holy, producing visions and encounters with the &quot;gods?&quot; They all have canopies of light called domes, each transmitting the presence of a galactic star. What is the geomantic origin of the Bermuda Triangle? Two dysfunctional stargates. If working properly, they and the Earth&#39;s other two million stargates could transport us rapidly to other planets. Is there a way to travel quickly across the planet without using cars, airplanes, boats, or trains? Yes, and it&#39;s called a traversable wormhole, and the Earth has thousands of them awaiting our discovery and use. Come join the tour of a planet you&#39;ve never seen before: our own star-infused Earth.&lt;p&gt;" />
