  <title>Spiritual Awakening - Oziris M. Stoltz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The wisdom that the 2012 code can inspire in us is to look directly at our lives, right here and now: What are our spiritual guiding principles? How can we live in greater harmony with all our personal relations? How can we embody genuine compassion? How can we become increasingly aware and self-reflective? How can we deepen our humility? How can we share our talents and gifts as a way to influence our culture and help manifest the new paradigm? How can we be of service to life, and positively contribute to the whole? How can we cultivate a balance of being and doing, receptivity and action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this diverse planet, we all have different strengths, different abilities, different callings. Rather than looking to the world to show us our path, we need to look deep within our spiritual being and listen to our inner sense of how to navigate these times of the great unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential we learn to hear the voice of our inner wisdom, our spiritual self. No one can give us wisdom; it is within all of us, born of our own direct experience. We each have our own direct connection to our spirit, and we must keep learning how to hear our divine, intuitive directives, whispering within. Th is ability to hear the voice of our inner guidance is the most practical skill we can cultivate in these times. It is what will inform us to how to synchronize in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
