  <title>Tai Divination Workbook - Erik Thorell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Erik Thorell reveals his new publication, &lt;em&gt;TAI Divination Workbook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAI Divination is the fusion of three ancient divination systems: Tarot, Astrology and the I Ching or TAI. These 3 systems have come together in one reading, probably for the first time ever in the history of divination. You don&#39;t have to be psychic to use TAI, and TAI is easy to understand for beginners, and in-depth enough for experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAI is not intended to compete with or replace existing forms of divination or Holy Scriptures of various religions. They all originally come from the Divine that lives within a man to help, advise and guide him in his life. The author respects all the founders equally as God&#39;s messengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings to mind of a bowl full of small cards with quotes from the Bible, a device which his Salvation Army parents used to ask questions via the ancient art of bibliomancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAI was accidentally discovered February 11th 1981 and co-incidentally published in 2015, the third year of the Aquarian age. Pray that the Divine within speaking via &quot;TAI&quot; advises all equally kindly and wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
