  <title>The VISION and the VOICE - Aleister Crowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aleister Crowley was a noted and controversial occultist, ceremonial magician and poet. He has been called &amp;quot;the wickedest man in the world&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;or &amp;quot;The Great Beast 666 &amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Master Therion&amp;quot; but he remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counterculture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This book contains his visions in the Sahara of the 30 Aethyres of the &lt;b&gt;Enochian Magick&lt;/b&gt;. Of all his works, Crowley considered this book to be second in importance behind&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Book of the Law&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. This is a valuable book to anyone interested in occult studies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Complete text and Footnotes (&amp;gt;800) by Aleister Crowley&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt&lt;/b&gt;: &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;The Cry of the 27th Aethyr&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Which is Called ZAA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;There is an angel with rainbow wings, and his dress is green&amp;nbsp;with silver, a green veil over silver&amp;nbsp;armour. Flames of many-coloured fire dart from him in all directions. It is a woman of some thirty years old, and she has the moon for a crest, and the moon is blazoned on her heart, and her sandals are curved silver, like the moon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And she cries: Lonely am I and cold in the wilderness of the stars. For I am the queen of all them that dwell in Heaven, and the queen of all them that are pure upon earth, and the queen of all the sorcerers of hell.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I am the daughter of Nuit, the lady of the stars. And I am the Bride of them that are vowed unto loneliness. And I am the mother of the Dog Cerberus. One person am I, and three gods.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And thou who hast blasphemed me shalt suffer knowing me. For I am cold as thou art cold, and burn with thy fire. Oh, when shall the war of the Aires and the elements be accomplished?&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo;" />
