  <title>Looks to Lift the Spirit - J. Bernard Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The format of this book is unique, featuring an acrostic on the word LOOK. The purpose of the book is to provide Biblical insights for daily living.  The discussion of each Bible passage is an acrostic of the word LOOK. The letter L stands for the lesson or purpose of the Scripture. The letter O represents the outline of the passage. The next letter  O contains an overview of the passage, and the letter K asks a reflective question about it.  Each LOOK ends with a sentence prayer. Readers may browse for  LOOKS which might seem appropriate for them at that time, or read them all consecutively. He sincerely hopes the book will benefit the readers in meeting their daily spiritual needs. These LOOKS come from sermons preached through the years, but the format makes them more than just a book of sermons.  They are synopses of sermons with an interesting format getting to the main points of the message with an opportunity for response. A special section of the book deals with LOOKS in building a great church. These LOOKS including prayer, witnessing, teaching, and serving are signs of strong, vibrant churches that are on a continual journey of renewal and transformation." />
