  <title>Heal Your Mind and Your Body Will Heal, Book 1 - Rev. Dr. Alma Marie Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most people were not taught how to use the power of thought at an early age. Hence, we find it necessary to learn in our later years. Much of what we think we think is simply a repetition of old thoughts and behavior patterns we rehash, with no positive results. We cannot keep thinking the same thoughts and expect to have different experiences. &lt;i&gt;Heal Your Mind and Your Body Will Heal&lt;/i&gt; is a tool that helps one to clear the mind to think. Thinking is carrying an idea out to its logical conclusion. The prayers are designed to affect the spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical part of the body. Expect changes to take place in your relationship with yourself and with others. &lt;i&gt;Heal Your Mind and Your Body Will Heal&lt;/i&gt; is different in that change takes place as a result of practicing the prayers that are associated with each condition. Your task is to say the prayers until you feel differently about the event or condition. &lt;i&gt;Heal Your Mind and Your Body Will Heal&lt;/i&gt; offers a new way to pray or clear the mind to receive new ideas. It appears an easy task, and it is. The prayers can be read aloud or silently; the effect is the same. The power is within the words that are spoken. You will find that you become more aware of your surroundings, and you will be able to make decisions more quickly. You will feel true love for yourself." />
