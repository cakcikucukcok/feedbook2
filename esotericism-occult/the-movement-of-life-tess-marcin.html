  <title>The Movement of Life - Tess Marcin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;THE MOVEMENT OF LIFE&lt;P&gt;(Essays from The Spirit For The Spirit)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Life is indeed a movement. It pulsates with energy... It is energy.&lt;P&gt;	From one moment to the next it surprises us in its diversity. It encompasses all in the moment of the now.&lt;P&gt;	Man tends to measure life in years. He begins his count at the moment of birth and ends it at the moment it ceases. He claims it in X number of years. But that is only the cycle of one individual and although it may be measured by a number it really is only a moment in time. &lt;P&gt;	We all live the life we are given in the moment of our eternality. We all live the moment as a human during the cycle within the eternal circle of life.	&lt;P&gt;	During our cycle in time we use lifes energy to pursue life as a human. We create, we give action to what we create, we go with the flow, always forward, never backward. As water never flows upstream only downstream, so it is with humanity.&lt;P&gt;	Communication, dialogue, philosophical dis- course, all part of an action of mans gifts... His tongue, his mind.&lt;P&gt;	A phrase of the moment is... Been there, done that. A glib aside, but nonetheless there is much truth in it. Man has been there, here, and everywhere. He has done it, many times. He has used his gift of choice, of free will, to move himself in the direction of his choice. His movement, his cycle, his time within the circle.&lt;P&gt;What has man learned? Not much! If you ask anyone that question, the answer will come back bracketed within his cycle in time. Here he will cite his progress, here he will cite what he considers of import. According to him, he is a success. Is he? Maybe...as man.&lt;P&gt;	But...but... Man is for the moment. He is the matter containing more than what he believes himself to be. This vessel, this matter, this enrobement, has a higher purpose. It is the housing being used by spirit. Spirit that made the choice to learn about life as a human, to experience it as a human. Spirit that is the energy known as... THE MOVEMENT OF LIFE.&lt;P&gt;	When the phrase, Know thyself is used, its meaning eludes the individual, because he believes it to mean the human individual. So when we ask, What has man learned? We can state, Not much! &lt;P&gt;	Man seeks, but he seeks as the human he is. Man has yet to begin his search as the self he represents. It is this self that is referred to in, Know thyself.&lt;P&gt;	THE MOVEMENT OF LIFE, a book written to encourage all those who read it to seek the meaning of life. To seek its energy, to seek the flow.&lt;P&gt;	Within THE MOVEMENT OF LIFE is the moment of life, and the moment of life is not in years, it is in the blink of an eye. It is in the now... One foot always poised for entry, as well as for exit.&lt;P&gt;	The past, the future, all in the now. All as part of&lt;P&gt;THE MOVEMENT OF LIFE&lt;/P&gt;" />
