  <title>Earth Works: Selected Essays - Scott Russell Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In the hands of award-winning writer Scott Russell Sanders, the essay becomes an inquisitive and revelatory form of art. In 30 of his finest essays-nine never before collected-Sanders examines his Midwestern background, his father&#39;s drinking, his opposition to war, his literary inheritance, and his feeling for wildness. He also tackles such vital issues as the disruption of Earth&#39;s climate, the impact of technology, the mystique of money, the ideology of consumerism, and the meaning of sustainability. Throughout, he asks perennial questions: What is a good life? How do family and culture shape a person&#39;s character? How should we treat one another and the Earth? What is our role in the cosmos? Readers and writers alike will find wisdom and inspiration in Sanders&#39;s luminous and thought-provoking prose.&lt;/P&gt;" />
