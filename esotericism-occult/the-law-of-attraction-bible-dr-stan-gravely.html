  <title>The Law of Attraction Bible - Dr. Stan Gravely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For ages, men and women have anticipated and looked forward to this time of expansion, transformation, and awakening to new truths. Deep inside, prophets, gurus, avatars, dreamers, wise men, wizards, witches, sorcerers, preachers, leaders, and everyday people have always known there is something more to life than what meets the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stan Gravelys &lt;i&gt;The Law of Attraction Bible&lt;/i&gt; is a compilation of truths the universe has delivered to the world in these exciting days. Many of us have searched all our lives for truth that is not mixed with religion, politics, and human reason. We are living in a time when truth is revealed in myriad ways, causing the expansion of infinite intelligence throughout the earth. Gravely describes how people come to earth to live a life of love, joy, peace, goodness, and abundance. People have the power to create the life they choose. By dreaming, thinking, and imagining what we want, we send out vibrational energies to attract what we desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Law of Attraction Bible&lt;/i&gt; will help you to awaken and attune to your true self and empower you to live a life of love, joy, peace, and abundance. Yes, you can have the life you want.&lt;/p&gt;" />
