  <title>America Before - Graham Hancock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was an advanced civilization lost to history in the global cataclysm that ended the last Ice Age? Graham Hancock, the internationally bestselling author, has made it his life&#39;s work to find out--and in &lt;i&gt;America Before&lt;/i&gt;, he draws on the latest archaeological and DNA evidence to bring his quest to a stunning conclusion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&#39;ve been taught that North and South America were empty of humans until around 13,000 years ago - amongst the last great landmasses on earth to have been settled by our ancestors. But new discoveries have radically reshaped this long-established picture and we know now that the Americas were first peopled more than 130,000 years ago - many tens of thousands of years before human settlements became established elsewhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hancock&#39;s research takes us on a series of journeys and encounters with the scientists responsible for the recent extraordinary breakthroughs. In the process, from the Mississippi Valley to the Amazon rainforest, he reveals that ancient &quot;New World&quot; cultures share a legacy of advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated spiritual beliefs with supposedly unconnected &quot;Old World&quot; cultures. Have archaeologists focused for too long only on the &quot;Old World&quot; in their search for the origins of civilization while failing to consider the revolutionary possibility that those origins might in fact be found in the &quot;New World&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;America Before: The Key to Earth&#39;s Lost&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Civilization&lt;/i&gt; is the culmination of everything that millions of readers have loved in Hancock&#39;s body of work over the past decades, namely a mind-dilating exploration of the mysteries of the past, amazing archaeological discoveries and profound implications for how we lead our lives today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
