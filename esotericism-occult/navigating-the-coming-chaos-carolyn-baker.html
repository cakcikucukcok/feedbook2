  <title>Navigating the Coming Chaos - Carolyn Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The collapse of industrial civilization, well underway since at least 2007, presents humankind with unprecedented and daunting challenges in the area of energy, environment, and economics. Just as the &lt;i&gt;Transition Handbook of 2008&lt;/i&gt;, provided specific strategies for addressing these changes logistically, &lt;i&gt;Navigating The Coming Chaos&lt;/i&gt;, provides a toolkit of emotional and spiritual preparation for an uncertain future. It offers us an opportunity to step across an evolutionary threshold in order to become a new kind of human being living in conscious self-awareness of our intimate connection with all life in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deepening the work begun in &lt;i&gt;Sacred Demise&lt;/i&gt;, Carolyn Baker has assembled - and life tested - a rich compendium of tools for the inner warrior preparing to meet civilizations collapse with inner strength, purpose, and presence. In times like these that try our souls, embarking on the deep self-reflection invited by this book will be as essential as any practical preparations for the Long Emergency.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Janaia Donaldson, Co-Producer and Host of Peak Moment TV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Navigating the Coming Chaos&lt;/i&gt; is Carolyn Bakers latest, and most important work. As we face up to the reality of collapse, the difference between those former citizens who cope and those who dont may well be a simple case of who has taken heed of the lessons contained within these priceless pages.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Keith Farnish, author of &lt;i&gt;TIMES UP: AN UNCIVILIZED SOLUTION TO A GLOBAL CRISIS&lt;/i&gt; and manager of The Earth Blog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use this book like you would a longtime friend who is willing to listen to you thoroughly but will still ask you the tough questions. It is an invaluable tool for people who are committed to creating a fulfilling life no matter what the future brings.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
