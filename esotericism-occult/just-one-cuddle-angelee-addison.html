  <title>Just One Cuddle - Angelee Addison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faye, the middle child, was the scapegoat for her familys frustrations.  She was physically and mentally abused, but despite their feelings towards her, she loved them unconditionally.   Fayes first boyfriend raped her.   That night she broke down sobbing to her mother.   She was unexpectedly kind and gave Faye a cuddle.   The next day she had a change of heart.  Sex was never discussed, and cleverly her mother diverted responsibility by calling Faye a dirty slut.  A couple of years later Faye met John.   He was regarded as a Superhero, by her birth family for marrying the likes of Faye.  Blessed with a girl then a boy; Faye thought she was in heaven.  It went wrong when Fayes perfect husband started drinking most weekends.  It was after a night out Faye&#39;s husband and Liz their best friend passionately embraced in-front of their partners and Johns father who was waiting to drive them home.   They laughed at Faye, saying it was only a bit of fun, and she was being ridiculous.  To John, it was nothing; however, it meant everything to Faye.   He continued to drink, but Faye remained grateful.   He was weak-natured; and sided with Faye&#39;s bullying family only a few months later.   It left his wife exposed and vulnerable.   Faye tried desperately to hold on to her dreams, determined to keep her precious family together.  Circumstances forced John and Faye to separate. Faye made countless sacrifices, whilst John demoralised, intimidated and controlled her for eighteen years. 
    It is after recovering from breast cancer, Faye realises how selfish to think so little of herself, when others hadnt survived.    When her existence became threatened, her life increased in value, perhaps not to her family, but to her.  
    Almost all her family rejected her, except one-man  he never let her down." />
