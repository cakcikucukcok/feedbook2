  <title>Letting Go of Yesterday&#39;s Pain: Carol&#39;s Story - Violet O. Cox Ph.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Letting Go of Yesterdays Pain is a story passionately narrated by Carol as she struggles to find herself in the midst of family feuds, lies, murder, incest, and deception. The book starts out at a slow pace, as the heroine wrestles with her inner conflicts of whether to be publicly transparent or to remain cocooned in her past. However, the momentum of the story picks up when she finally bursts forth from the struggle and unabashedly travels vividly through the chapters of her lifes story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pseudo-autobiographical fashion, Carol chronicles her childhood years that wove the pattern for her adolescent and later adult years of deprivation, rebellion, mistrust, and promiscuity. The deeper structure of the book speaks to two very fundamental building blocks of human existence: the role of the family in shaping the destiny of each member and the unquestionable providential hand of God still guiding a soul in spite of bad choices. The discussion sections based on each chapter provided in the appendix offer biblical authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
