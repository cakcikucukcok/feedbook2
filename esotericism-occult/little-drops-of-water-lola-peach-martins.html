  <title>Little Drops of Water - Lola-Peach Martins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wisdom fuel is a positive stimulant for the mind, body, and soul. If you think its easier said than done, Ive already taken that myth into consideration. Ive written and designed the book to accommodate your learning needs. Whenever someone advises me on a matter and the dictum its easier said than done springs to mind, I remind myself that I must still make the effort rather than allow inertia to set in. Im encouraging you to do the same too. &lt;br /&gt;
For a healthy mind, body, and soul, you need the right kind of spiritual fuel; this book goes a long way in providing it. You can use the book for your benefit and, by doing so, increase the likelihood that, through you, it may benefit others too. Remember the saying, Little drops of water  make a mighty ocean and a bounteous land. &lt;br /&gt;
The book may be read in any number of wayssequentially, by title, or through use of the categorical index. However you choose to engage with the material, it can offer you great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;
