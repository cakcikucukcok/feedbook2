  <title>True Feminine Power - Sarah Emily-Anne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;WHAT IF YOU COULD&lt;/P&gt;
 Be 100% fulfi lled right now without needing anything.&lt;/br&gt;
 Find the source of your unwavering confi dence. .&lt;/br&gt;
 Know every right choice directly from your hearts intuition. &lt;/br&gt;
 Feel truly beautiful in the body you have right now.&lt;/br&gt;
 Attract genuine love from others into your life. &lt;/br&gt;
 Discover the easier feminine way to manifest. &lt;/br&gt;
 Speak from your heart so that others are more responsive. &lt;/br&gt;
 Have more fulfilling time with genuine feminine friends. &lt;/br&gt;
 Bring out the best in the feminine beings around you.&lt;/br&gt;
 Dissolve other womens closed-ness to you in an instant. &lt;/br&gt;
 Be free of others criticism of you. &lt;/br&gt;
 Turn around any distressing situation. &lt;/br&gt;
 Be free of your old fears and hurts quickly and safely.&lt;/br&gt;
 End feeling others emotions, just feel and clear your own.&lt;/br&gt;
 Find bliss in the feminine way to meditate. &lt;/br&gt;
 Ignite and boost your creative passions.&lt;/br&gt;
 Connect deeply with Mother Earth and her wisdom.&lt;/br&gt;
 Live your deepest feminine purpose and true power.&lt;/br&gt;
 Be the one you have always wanted to be.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are very few women role models who are able to carry the power to do what is needed while equally embracing her depth as a woman. Sarahs practices in each chapter actually help to build a womans ability to live from that sacred place of love within herself. I recommend this as a go-to book for inspiration and guidance to any woman who feels that there might be more to her life.&lt;/P&gt;
