  <title>A Miracle Worker&#39;s Primer - Anna Sweetnam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life can be easy or as difficult as we want; it is a choice! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today you are invited into the Keller household, like a fly on the wall, to witness family challenges not much different than your own. Take their lead and use this primer as a handy guide to champion your will and the will of the ones you love. Embrace a bigger picture of day to day life. Honor the Fourth Dimension; honor your Spirit, which cries for you to understand this higher dimension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirit cries for inner disciplinethe discipline necessary to tap into genuine potential. We are so much more than the life drama that we create and the drama that surrounds us. Know that in as little as a nanosecond we can shift from an overwrought, emotional human mess to a grounded, sure-footed spiritual being. We can have a great day, or we can create a great day! Feel that nanosecond shift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this creating that we begin to tap into genuine potential, living life in harmony, synchronicity, and bliss. Life aligns. Not until then can we begin to tap into and build on the essence of who we are and who we are meant to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, some would say you live a life of good luck, but we know its a life of better thinking, aligning, and manifestingof constant conscious connections toward actively seeking heaven on earth as a miracle worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now life is easy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
