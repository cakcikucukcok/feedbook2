  <title>Birding Through Cancer - Karin Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do you do when your world has been turned upside down by some unexpected news?&lt;br&gt;
How do you cope with the enormity of not knowing how things will unfold?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inspirational memoir takes you on one woman&#39;s journey weathering a frightening diagnosis by immersing herself in nature. Guiding you on mindful walks, at every turn you share in the discovery of poignant metaphors, revealing that you inherently possess the necessary resources to traverse life&#39;s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many books I have read about the Cancer experience, Birding Through Cancer is completely unique. Karin Marcus walks a path through the challenges of life-threatening illness with the sensitive eye of an expert bird watcher and the wise perspective of a seasoned Life Coach. She has filled her book with wonderful quotes and exquisite pictures of the creatures of the sky. The outcome is a one of a kind book which is a passionate celebration of the love of life that is the foundation of all healing. It will inspire you.&lt;br&gt;
RACHEL NAOMI REMEN, MD, author of the New York Times bestseller, Kitchen Table Wisdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While very personal, this book deals with universal themes. Life is a journey, and a life enriched by birds is an adventure, a life worth living and nurturing.&lt;br&gt;
Pete Dunne, author, birder and retired director of the Cape May Bird Observatory &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiring. Poignant. Full of hope! Reading Karin&#39;s story will open a path to restoring vitality in your lifeno matter what you are healing from.&lt;br&gt;
Carol McClelland, PhD, author of Seasons of Change: Using Nature&#39;s Wisdom to Grow Through Life&#39;s Inevitable Ups and Downs&lt;/p&gt;" />
