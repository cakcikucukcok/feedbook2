  <title>Me, My Man, My Lord - Andrea Tootle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In writing this book, I found direction and guidance from God, in the name of Jesus, by the Holy Spirit of God.  I always knew there was someone watching over me.  It wasnt until my, then, spouse gave me the Bible to read that I gained understanding about life through reading Gods Word.  God drew me in quietly and with a loving heart.  He spoke to me through the words written in His Will, the Holy Bible.  It is my hope this book will be a guidepost in the maturation of Gods children.  Throughout life, the enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy, but Jesus came that we might have life life more abundantly.  God is love and self love is very important because hurt people, hurt people.  Romans 8 helps Gods children walk in the Spirit of God, and I hope this manuscript will offer a framework for our new nature in Christ Jesus for Believers.  
Ephesians 4: (11) It was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers. (12)  to prepare Gods people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up (13) until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ." />
