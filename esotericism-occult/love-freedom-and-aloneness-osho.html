  <title>Love, Freedom, and Aloneness - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho, one of the greatest spiritual thinkers of the twentieth century, explores the connections between ourselves and others in&lt;i&gt; Love, Freedom, and Aloneness: The Koan of Relationships&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today&#39;s world, freedom is our basic condition, and until we learn to live with that freedom, and learn to live by ourselves and with ourselves, we are denying ourselves the possibility of finding love and happiness with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love can only happen through freedom and in conjunction with a deep respect for ourselves and the other. Is it possible to be alone and not lonely? Where are the boundaries that define &quot;lust&quot; versus &quot;love&quot;...and can lust ever grow into love? In &lt;i&gt;Love, Freedom, and Aloneness&lt;/i&gt; you will find unique, radical, and intelligent perspectives on these and other essential questions. In our post-ideological world, where old moralities are out of date, we have a golden opportunity to redefine and revitalize the very foundations of our lives. We have the chance to start afresh with ourselves, our relationships to others, and to find fulfillment and success for the individual and for society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
