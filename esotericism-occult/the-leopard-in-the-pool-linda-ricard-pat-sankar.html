  <title>The Leopard in the Pool - Linda Ricard, Pat Sankar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The tidal wave of transformation has taken a hold of humanity. Never before in history have humans been overwhelmed by the tsunami of information presented by electronics of all kinds.  We are now immersed in the super cyber highway of information and surrounded by the spider web of communications spanning the depths of the oceans to synchronized satellite constellations in space. We now exist in a virtual world where our neural network is wired like never before; people communicate via their computers or text rather than talk face-to-face, relationships evolve online, creativity and breakthrough innovation is stifled  where holding a thought is a fleeting fancy replaced with the insatiable emotional need for instant gratification, entertainment and constant stimulation. 
People are becoming disenchanted with the corporate greed that brought Wall Street to its knees and the lack of social consciousness by corporations and government that is slowly destroying the worlds food chain, climate and environment. 
The world seems to have turned upside down; where common sense and dignity and respect for others have been discarded and replaced by reality shows and fame-seeking, self-promoting acts of atrocity by individuals more than willing to sacrifice themselves to the media for their moment in glory and monetary compensation.  Money has become the name of the game in our new global community, where profits are now taking precedent over the health and well-being of inhabitants on this planet we call earth.   
Individuals from every walk of life and country and community are seeking answers to how we can turn this bus around and set the world on the right trajectory again. The answers are alluding, hidden deep within the spider web of chaos and confusion that is the propulsion driving our society today. 
Tired of continually searching for common sense, peace and happiness from external sources, people are now beginning to look within themselves to seek the answers to the questions that brought them here. The world has become a hostile place where one seeks refuge from within rather than depending on external factors to provide the security they seek. Material possessions and ego gratification are being replaced with prayers to a higher power to answer the questions resonating in the soul as to who we are and what is our purpose in this lifetime on earth?  
As the world integrates economies, communications and business practices, so too are individuals from all walks of life, cultures, religions and intellects coming together to challenge the boundaries of religion and governing bodies. The lines of religious and governmental demarcation are also blurring with the lines on a map as more and more of us realize that everyone is the same and that our shared destiny of humanity is what links us to the all encompassing source of light and love from which we come from.  Our similarities far outweigh our differences which are rapidly becoming a source of inspiration and personal growth.
As one reads through this extraordinary journey of a young man of South Indian origin brought up in the United States, Vivek Venki Venkatraman, who travels to India in search of the ultimate spiritual wisdom, one cant help but be pulled into the storyline. Like many of us, the main character had worked in a corporation and was disenchanted with the greed of the corporate world. He too craved to understand his purpose here on earth and how he could live selflessly and affect a positive change in others.  He too was curious as to if there was more to this one-dimensional existence and our role in it. 
This book chronicles Viveks struggles to balance three basic human urges of wanting to exist forever, wanting to know more, and wanting to perpetually exist in a state of happiness and bliss in his grand pursuit of ultimate wisdom which he thinks is always out of reach.  He has one foot in two seemingly different cultures; a Western cultur" />
