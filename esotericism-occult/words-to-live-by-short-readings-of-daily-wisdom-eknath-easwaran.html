  <title>Words to Live By: Short Readings of Daily Wisdom - Eknath Easwaran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In the midst of our busy world we need islands of calm, where we can seek refuge and find wise guidance. Easwaran&amp;#8217;s short spiritual readings, one for each day of the year, can be read in the morning to start the day in the right direction, or in the evening to prepare for a peaceful night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This encouraging collection includes inspirational quotations from sages of all ages and all traditions. Emily Dickinson and Catherine of Genoa, John Milton and Jalaluddin Rumi, Augustine and Einstein, the Hindu Upanishads and the Hasidic proverbs, Buddhist sutras and Biblical verses can all be found in this varied collection of thoughts for each day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Each quote is accompanied by Easwaran&amp;#8217;s short commentary. Some days we are offered a gentle reminder to slow down, to discover the richness of being mindful and patient. Other days give inspiration to change habits, or advice about mending a relationship. At times we read the words of a sympathetic friend who can help us through a dark day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For those wishing to explore a particular theme further, each page includes references to related entries for other days of the year. Some readings refer to Easwaran&amp;#8217;s method of passage meditation, and a brief summary of his program is included at the end of the book.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
