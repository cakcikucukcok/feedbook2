  <title>Healing Humanity from Behind the Shears - Jennifer Zerba, Dr. Bill Hayes D.C., Isabel Lucio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do You Believe: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ You are of value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ You are just a job description?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Your art of touch has a higher purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ That what you think, what you say, and how you act make a difference? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Healing Humanity from Behind the Shears you are challenged and encouraged to achieve a higher level of gratitude, awareness, and self-appreciation that will transcend you through clients; therefore, making our world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wonderful read and lesson for everyone, not just for cosmetologists, on how to work at and be mindful everyday with the power of kindness and love that affects everyone we come into contact. Healing Humanity From Behind the Shears will help you enjoy life by teaching you deep breathing, meditation, and exercise. Be nice because it matters, should be everyones daily goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kelly Cole, cosmetologist for over twenty-three years &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zerba did a great job describing the importance of a cosmetologists healing touch. I would recommend this book to cosmetology students and to any professional who has forgotten how important our profession is to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Beth Benavidez, owner of A Cut Above Salon; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cosmetologist for over thirty years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has a passion to serve others. You dont need to wield a pair of shears to impact people in a positive ad profound way. Jennifer shares her love of humanity with us, and it is contagious!&lt;/p&gt;
