  <title>Return to Life - Jim B. M.D. Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tucker, in a follow-up to his book &lt;i&gt;Life Before Life&lt;/i&gt;, explores American cases of young children who report memories of previous lives in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Return to Life&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A first-person account of Jim Tucker&#39;s experiences with a number of extraordinary children with memories of past lives, &lt;i&gt;Return to Life&lt;/i&gt; focuses mostly on American cases, presenting each family&#39;s story and describing his investigation. His goal is to determine what happened--what the child has said, how the parents have reacted, whether the child&#39;s statements match the life of a particular deceased person, and whether the child could have learned such information through normal means. Tucker has found cases that provide persuasive evidence that some children do, in fact, possess memories of previous lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among others, readers will meet a boy who describes a previous life on a small island. When Tucker takes him to that island, he finds that some details eerily match the boy&#39;s statements and some do not. Another boy points to a photograph from the 1930s and says he used to be one of the men in it. Once the laborious efforts to identify that man are successful, many of the child&#39;s numerous memories are found to match the details of his life. Soon after his second birthday, a third boy begins expressing memories of being a World War II pilot who is eventually identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought-provoking and captivating, &lt;i&gt;Return to Life &lt;/i&gt;urges its readers to think about life and death and reincarnation, and reflect about  their own consciousness and spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
