  <title>The Way of the Warrior Priestess - Aya, Charmian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A woman who struggles on the spiritual path needs validation, guidance, inspiration and practical advice. This handbook is to help her survive the transition of the past several centuries and come to her full empowerment. This is especially for she who needs to reprogram herself as the Warrior Priestess in what is still a mans world. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is for the one who seeks to understand her place as the embodiment of the Divine Feminine Spirit because now it is time to uplift the wounded feminine consciousness to its rightful power, to transmute the negative results of ignorance and subjugation. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book is a call and a guide for the neophyte on the Path as well as for all the extraordinary women who are searching for a Friend in the dark, when they are feeling most damned and abandoned because of their Vision. It is for all the Spiritual Warrior/Priestesses who have forgotten some of the pitfalls, as well as the joys, of their Journey. This book will serve as an inspiration for those who have lost that Sight.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the playing field of womens spirituality, no one book or resource offers such a clear picture of the magical destiny of the Woman of Tomorrow, especially for those with eclectic beliefs. THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR PRIESTESS addresses this need for self transformation by inspiring the reader with important quotations as well as the authors guidance, step by step direction, affirmations, useful astrological insights, as well as a section that asks questions that will push the reader into changing some tired perceptions. It is written to fire up the spirit of the sleeping Feminine Spirit in both women and men.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is a handbook and empowerment manual for the growing army of individuals born at this special time in Mother Earths history to help rebalance Her during certain changes. ...for all of those brave souls willing to go in an exciting new direction. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;WHY THE READER SHOULD READ THIS BOOK&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is not another book about the womens spirituality movement or about why women are goddesses. Rather it is a bridge between traditional magickal wisdom and the everyday challenges of the woman of the 90s.  It is a call to transformation and will answer the intense desire for women of all ages and colors to heal their lives. It will give them permission and purpose to become what they really are: perfected beings.  It will also bring on an almost-instant wakeup call for men.  It embraces no particular theology, religion or mythology and is not a psychological treatise. It does not advocate any one path to take, nor is it anti anything except ignorance....It does come from a spacious metaphysical vision that many will relate to with a sigh of relief. &lt;P&gt;The average woman is still rather paralyzed and in partial ignorance of her power as a Magical Being...because she does not even have the voice or words to help herself. And most books on this subject are still either too academic or beyond the average womans experiences. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book will serve as a tool and a light to help her see herself. The Talking Stick section at the end of each chapter is to jumpstart some profound self questioning - as well as a handy starting point in teaching situations....ideal to teach self empowerment workshops all over the world. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The extensive Resources section at the back of the book is to help locate the key material for the process. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book will be appropriate for several markets: Feminist, Goddess, Spiritual, Metaphysical, Womens Self Help. It should be in metaphysical centers, universities, feminist study groups, and womens conferences and gatherings. It is for women ages 16-90 who seek inspiration and practical advice. It is for men who are trying to align with the female spirit, both in wom" />
