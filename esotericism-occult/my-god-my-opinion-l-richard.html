  <title>My God, My Opinion - L Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is a surreal trip to the valley of the unknown. At times it feels like we were born thrown into the main arena of the coliseum gladiator pit of life. The ups and downs of an ongoing battle where we must abide rules of survival can create discouragement, which can cause us to stray from an end result to a finishing point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all started from somewherean unknown organism changing into human formbut we have questions: Where did we originate from? Why are we here on earth? Are we doing what we are supposed to be doing here? Is life here a punishment? And why is the time before birth blocked from our memory? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an exploration of the soula tour into the journey of our existence. This book is not about religion; it is a hypothetical version of my view on why we are living here on earth. My intention is for us to become more conscious of the one shot we have as we live our current lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of our souls have stories to tell, what would yours say? In this book, I am sharing my soul story in a memoir. This is a voyage into the mind of another human being, and this visit to my inner world may appear at times dark. This is because I have overcome some of my demons, but I must confess I have yet still other demons to wrestle with mentally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share with you my thoughts and see if they lend a hand in your plight here. We are all lost at some point in our lives and at times are led by a misguided life compass. My goal is to assist you in your bad day, bad week, or bad life, and to make you stop and think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this book exactly how it was conveyed to me by the voices that live in my head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God blesswhatever vision of God may be to you. &lt;/p&gt;" />
