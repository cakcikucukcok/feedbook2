      <meta name="description" content="Literally translated as &quot;wind-water,&quot; feng shui is the ancient Chinese art of working with the natural flow of an environment to create harmony in space. It is also a phenomenon across the United States, rapidly shedding its New Age, incense-and-candles image to become a generally accepted way of designing home and work areas for health, wealth, and prosperity. Yet, with all the expensive consultants and self-styled gurus out there, how do you find plain, reliable information on this exciting practice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look no further. The Learning Annex Presents Feng Shui packs all the knowledge, tools, and special tips of a Learning Annex seminar into a book with answers to questions like:&lt;br&gt;* What is feng shui? &lt;br&gt;* What are its basic principles?&lt;br&gt;* How can I analyze my home for good chi and correct problem areas?&lt;br&gt;* How can I enhance specific life areas?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of sidebars and other special features, The Learning Annex Presents Feng Shui gives you the tools and knowledge you need to create spaces that will enhance and improve your life-and all in a single night&#39;s reading!" />
