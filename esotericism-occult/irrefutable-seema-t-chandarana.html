  <title>Irrefutable - Seema T. Chandarana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With each of these stories, reality reflects back my beliefs, and I realize that a miracle has occurred: I have created my own reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But dont take my word for it. Try it out for yourself! I encourage you to look at your own stories to find evidence of the Law at work. I have confidence that you wont have to search too far back, as the Law is ineffable. In all my years of searching, I cannot find one example of an exception to the Law. Sometimes the answers are disguised, and sometimes they are obvious, and in every case, they are a direct result of my thoughts. I hope my stories inspire you to find meaning behind the twists, turns, and seemingly unexpected events in your life. Nothing is an accident, and nothing can come into our experience without our invitation. Once we own that, were sitting in the drivers seat on our way to a place of infinite possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So buckle up. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To see the Law of Attraction in action through an ordinary AND extraordinary life, read Seema Chandarana&#39;s personal, warm and humorous book, Irrefutable. Her love of this universal law is absolutely contagious and will catapult the reader into a closer relationship with it, as well. Many of her stories can be used as wonderful examples to deepen an understanding of how this beautiful Universe operates for our benefit behind the scenes. EnJOY!&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
