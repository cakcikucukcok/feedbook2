  <title>The Unfoldment - Denise Appelmans, Elaine Pace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Newly retired from a rewarding career in mental health services, Elaine appeared to have it all. Nestled in a comfortable lakeside home in Ontarios boreal forest, with strong roots in her community, Elaines life was seen as one of achievement, love and abundance, however emptiness haunted her. She felt she had missed out on something important in life, but could not identify what that was. Close to desperation, Elaine longed and prayed for illumination and the aliveness of her true, authentic self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite unexpectedly, Elaine met an Intuitive through whom she began a healing journey, with two Spirit Guides, Nathan and Mother  Ascended Masters who once walked the earth, and who lovingly began teaching Elaine how to reclaim her life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She learns, through the most challenging yet exhilarating conversations with the Teachers, that she is perfection, created to love and express herself fully in the world. Nathan and Mother teach her about Unfoldment: the process of discovering and allowing all aspects of the Self to emerge and be celebrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in an endearing format with plenty of humour, &lt;i&gt;The Unfoldment&lt;/i&gt; pulls the reader into this vigorous exchange, offering twelve dynamic teachings and concrete applications for living the life you have always desired to live!&lt;/p&gt;" />
