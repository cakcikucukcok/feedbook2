  <title>Not Church as Usual - Felicia Hamer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LaJune Daricious Greenfield is down on her luck. A few months ago she had the most wonderful lifeor so she thought. From being a lawyer to enjoying time with her children, suddenly everything changes. Her husband leaves her and takes all the savings. Shes left jobless and with two young kids to feed, no food in the refrigerator, and not a dime in her bank account. So where does she go from here? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not Church as Usual is the touching and sincere chronicle of a woman trying to put everything back togetherwith a lot of help from God. A story based on faith, hope, and some hard work, it illustrates how even with good moral character, bad things can still happen. But by living life according to Christian values and principles, LaJune shows us how we can overcome these challenges and discover a new life that is full of joy, peace, and love. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good still triumphs over evil in this story, and even though the world can test our faith, God will always be there to show us the path forward through the darkness and the valleys in life. Because in the end we all deserve a new beginning, and God will provide it for uswe just have to trust in his ways." />
