  <title>Who Is My Shelter? - Neta Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Gabby knows God is the God of second chances. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;But can she give one to the man who betrayed her?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When she was thrown out of the penthouse she shared with her husband and their sons, Gabby didn’t know if she’d ever find a soft place to land. But after seeking refuge at the shelter where she works, extraordinary things happen as she is reintroduced to God.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;From the ashes of her marriage comes the House of Hope—a safe haven for homeless moms and their children. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;But now those ashes of her destroyed marriage are being stirred again. When her long-gone husband’s life hits rock bottom, he reappears and asks for one more chance. And Gabby faces what feels like an impossible choice. Take him back. Or keep moving forward without him. Toward someone new who hasn’t betrayed her.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Is God redeeming what Gabby thought was gone forever? Or is He leading her down a&amp;nbsp;different path and giving her something—and someone—new? &lt;/P&gt;" />
