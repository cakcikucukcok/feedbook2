  <title>Just Can&#39;t Get Enough - Cheris Hodges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Both down-home sweet and seductive, Cheris Hodges&#39;s new novel is about breaking the rules, going back home.  .  .and finding more than your heart&#39;s desire.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Celina Hart had security, a steady job, a predictable fianc&amp;#233;.  .  .and nothing that was making her truly happy. She gave it all up to gamble on her talent, and found success she&#39;d never imagined as one of New York&#39;s hottest painters. But when she returns to her South Carolina hometown to care for her ailing father, she gets an even bigger surprise. That &quot;bow-legged&quot; neighbor&#39;s boy she used to play with has grown up into Darius McRae, a lawyer who gave up the D.C. fast-lane to get back to his roots. Now, Darius&#39; dark-chocolate build and slow, easy smile are proving to be just as tempting as any city lights.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    The last thing Darius was looking for was a relationship. He&#39;d been burned by too many women who put finance over romance--including his conniving ex-girlfriend Cortina. But Celina&#39;s sense of humor and unpretentious ways are igniting more than his passions. And when Cortina starts stirring up a mess of trouble, Darius will do whatever it takes to show Celina a home-grown love is a dream worth everything.  .  ." />
