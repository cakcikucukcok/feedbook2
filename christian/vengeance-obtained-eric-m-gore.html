  <title>Vengeance Obtained - Eric M Gore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marcel Dekrey, angel of The Lord and nine-hundred year old vampire, is a double agent in service to The Most High God. Marcel is charged with a clear mandate; observe and report to the heavenly host events as they unfold in the dangerous world of anomalies--vampires, werewolves, witches, warlocks, demonic creatures, and variations of each--which exists within our own, and intercede if and when necessity demands.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Necessity does indeed demand when Marcel learns a recent attack against him was orchestrated by his ancient enemy, Stefano the Gouge. The assault is part of his enemy&amp;rsquo;s plan to use Marcel&amp;#39;s duel nature to enact a ritual derived from a powerful artifact which has been in the possession of the human military since the end of World War II; The Book of the Dead.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This ritual will reprise the devil&amp;#39;s first fall from grace when one-third of all the angels followed him to the pit, ushering in a new demonic world order and humanity&amp;#39;s final day. Marcel must use his skill in swordsmanship and hand to hand combat, honed to their most ardent degree in nine hundred years of unlife, to stop Stefano before The Heavenly Host descends to Earth to carry out God&amp;#39;s will and puts an end to reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
