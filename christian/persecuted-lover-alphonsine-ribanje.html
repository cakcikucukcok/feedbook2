  <title>Persecuted Lover - Alphonsine Ribanje</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why? Why? Why do you persecute me? Jesus asked. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Persecuted Lover should inspire a personal reflection of who Jesus is in the life of the reader and the audience. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Acts 9:4, on the road to Damascus, Jesus asked Saul that same question. Sauls response was to ask Who are you, Lord? After finding out who he was persecuting, Saul experienced a personal conversion. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My hope is that unpacking and unwrapping the gift found in John 3:16 showcases Gods love, helps you see the magnificence of Jesuss love for you and the right-now power of Gods grace, and have a personal new encounter with Jesus. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The more you focus on the finished work of Christ on your behalf and believe that you have everything you need in Christ Jesus, the more the desire to satisfy any longing with the counterfeit vanishes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lords holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledgethat you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:1719).&lt;/p&gt;" />
