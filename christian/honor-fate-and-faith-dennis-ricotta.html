  <title>Honor, Fate, and Faith - Dennis Ricotta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leaving a loving wife and children to go to war is a difficult decision. Fighting for the better good, however, will drive that decision. &lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Crippled by a bullet, Mason Caldwell returns home. Family will be only part of his healing. People he meets and adventures he experiences bring him strength, peace, and deeper faith in the Lord he loves.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For the farm to flourish, Mason must rely on his son Mark. John, the adventurous younger son, finds a niche in law enforcement with a friend he meets on the streets of Crockett. Daughter Jennie finds true love in someone other than a cowboy. Who else is there in Texas besides cowhands or farmers?&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The local sheriff, however, has a quarrel with Mason, and things get very tense as this relationship comes to a head. A soldier enters the life of Captain Caldwell who needs to right a wrong from the time Mason was shot. A half-breed, Luke has also had a hard life, but love from a crippled girl may just be his redemption.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As these folks move through their lives, sharing their respect not only for each other but for all humanity, we will see their faith crowned by love from their hearts and grace from above.&lt;/p&gt;" />
