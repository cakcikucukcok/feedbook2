  <title>Mary’S Son - Frank Durham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marys Son is a fictional account of how Mary, the mother of our Savior, dealt with the challenges of his three-year ministry. She not only had to deal with the daily rejection of the people in the village of Nazareth but also the doubts of her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is this young carpenter who left his mother in the olive grove to go off and find his cousin, John, who claims to be the forerunner of the Messiah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary is aware that he is Gods son, and that he is destined for something special. But what is Gods plan for him? What does she tell her close friends and neighbors who love and support her? How does she convince her children to continue to have faith when their brother is performing miracles and claiming to be the Messiah? And how does she, as a mother, deal with the religious leaders rejection of him and threats to kill him? Finally, how does she cope with his trial before the Sanhedrin and Pilate, along with his flogging and crucifixion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a sequel to my first book, Joseph the Carpenter from Nazareth. Both books are my perception of what took place during Jesuss family life and his ministrys impact on his mother and siblings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because this book is work of fiction, I have paraphrased most of the scripture used. I encourage my readers to read all four of the Gospels because I intentionally left out most of the scripture where Jesus is speaking only to his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;" />
