  <title>Not Safe, but Good (vol 2) - Bret Lott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In C.S. Lewis&#39;s classic &lt;em&gt;The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;/em&gt;, Lucy asks if Aslan the lion is safe. It is quickly clarified that Aslan is not safe...but he is good. That concept serves as the foundation for this collection of short stories. While written from a Christian worldview, our goal isn&#39;t comfort food for Christians or G-rated stories that offer simplistic lessons. Instead, we&#39;re serving up stories sharpened by faith. Stories that will engage, challenge, entertain, and stretch the reader. These stories aren&#39;t necessarily safe...but without question, they are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories in this book--from such outstanding Chrstian writers as Jerry Jenkins, Michael Morris, Sally John, and the editor Bret Lott--are by no means safe. Like the parables of Christ, they surprise, unsettle, and even shock. They depict doubt, loss, abandonment, failure, and betrayal as well as elation and triumph. But they also deeply and meaningfully explore the human condition in relation to a God who loves us and brings us joy and hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
