  <title>A Midwinter&#39;s Tale - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Father Andrew M. Greeley, one of America&#39;s most popular and trusted storytellers, has long charmed readers with his chronicles of the crazy O&#39;Malleys, an irrepressible and resilient Irish American family caught up in the rush of modern American history. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Midwinter&#39;s Tale &lt;/i&gt;is the first book in the Family Saga series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stationed in Bamberg, Germany, in the chaotic aftermath of WWII, pint-sized Charles &quot;Chucky&quot; Cronin O&#39;Malley can&#39;t seem to keep himself out of harm&#39;s way. Whether it be with black marketeers, border patrols, or even his commanding officer, Chucky always seems to land in impossible scrapes, relying on a quick wit and blind luck (or is it Heavenly intervention?) to save his hide. And until the day he meets beautiful seventeen-year-old Trudi, a girl on the run from smugglers and the U.S. Army, he manages to keep himself in one piece. Trudi needs Chucky&#39;s help. If he isn&#39;t careful though, she may also make off with his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
