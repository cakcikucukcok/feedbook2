Slowly putting his life back together after losing his wife and two teen-age children in a horrific car crash, Keith is learning to rebuild his trust in God one step of faith at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can Abbie accept the goodness of God? Can Keith overcome his fear of losing someone he loves once more? Can Abbie be persuaded to open her heart againto Gods love and Keiths? &lt;I&gt;Abandon Not My Soul&lt;/I&gt; is the story of how hope and forgiveness saves them both.&lt;/p&gt;
