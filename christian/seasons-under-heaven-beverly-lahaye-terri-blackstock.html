  <title>Seasons Under Heaven - Beverly LaHaye, Terri Blackstock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tory Sullivan struggles with the demands of motherhood and her desire for a career. An aspiring writer, she wonders whether she&#39;ll ever be able to develop her talent while raising two young children. But perhaps the problem isn&#39;t a matter of time, but of Tory. Cathy Flaherty is rediscovering the grins and groans of the dating game. The spunky single mother of three teenagers, she&#39;s also learning the urgency of instilling sound values in her children as they attend public school. Sylvia Bryan is an empty-nester. Now that her children are gone, she struggles with a gnawing lack of meaning. Her husband, Harry, wants to become a medical missionary. But for Sylvia, the best part of life seems like nothing but a memory. Brenda Dodd faces an uncertain future. Her nine-year-old son is getting sicker, and there seems to be nothing they can do. It is every mother&#39;s nightmare -- a child who will die unless he receives a heart transplant. As the women of Cedar Circle band together to save a dying child, they learn that each moment is precious in every season under the heaven. Taking the best and worst of human circumstances -- the tender moments, the laughter, the tragedies, and the triumphs -- Beverly LaHaye and Terri Blackstock weave from them a poignant, warmly human novel. Gently uncovering the inner struggles, stresses, and joys that surface among neighbors living in a quiet cul-de-sac, the authors show us the power of ordinary lives being knit into a strong, many-textured fabric of family and friendships. Seasons Under Heaven depicts the deepest emotions of a woman&#39;s heart, and those circumstances, both thrilling and tragic, that test and strengthen Christian faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
