      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When tragedy strikes a family in Lancaster County, can two young Amish people find the hope that lies on the other side?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This story of profound loss and deep friendship will leave readers with the certain knowledge that hope exists and love grows through faith in our God of second chances.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Kelly Irvin, author of the Every Amish Season series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Riehl is no stranger to heartache. Less than a year after her mother&amp;rsquo;s death, Laura finds herself burying another loved one: her best friend, Savilla, who has died after a brief and sudden illness. Laura feels heartbroken and alone, but her pain is nothing compared to that of Allen, the husband Savilla has left behind. He now faces a life so different from the one he imagined&amp;mdash;plus a baby to care for on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Laura offers to help Allen with baby Mollie, he jumps at the opportunity until a permanent solution can be found. She&amp;rsquo;d do anything to lend a hand to Allen and to honor her best friend&amp;rsquo;s memory. Rudy, Laura&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend, is initially supportive of her plan, but the more time Laura spends with Allen, the more jealous and frustrated Rudy seems to become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Laura and Allen face hardships together, their friendship takes a surprising yet comforting turn&amp;mdash;and she discovers an attraction she&amp;rsquo;s never felt with Rudy. Would falling for Allen betray the people she cares about most, or would denying those feelings betray her heart? This latest installment in the Amish Homestead series returns us to Lancaster County, home of the beloved Riehls, where a family&amp;rsquo;s strength&amp;mdash;and advice from a new friend&amp;mdash;may help Laura find God&amp;rsquo;s direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This sweet read is the second book in Amy Clipston&amp;rsquo;s Amish Homestead series, but it can also be enjoyed as a standalone novel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Readers . . . will appreciate the author&amp;rsquo;s realistic portrayal of coming to terms with loss in order to continue living with hope and happiness.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;RT Book Reviews, four stars&lt;/p&gt;" />
