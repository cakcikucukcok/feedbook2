        &lt;p&gt;New preacher Wade Kendrick might as well have taken out an ad for a wife– all the church mamas paraded their daughters in front of him every Sunday.

        &lt;p&gt;Pearl had her eye on gospel stardom. She didn&#39;t fit into the preacher man&#39;s world any more than he fit into hers. But he was one fine black man– and their sexual chemistry downright sizzled. What was a sister to do?&lt;/p&gt;
