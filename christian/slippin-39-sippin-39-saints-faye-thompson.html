  <title>Slippin&#39; Sippin&#39; Saints - Faye Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Slippin&#39; Sippin&#39; Saints takes a scandalous peek inside the flawed flock of New York&#39;s Church of the One Way-where image is everything and nothing is what it seems.  From the pulpit to the door, no one escapes the addictively intoxicating atmosphere of mendacity, temptation, and sex. The church&#39;s married and miserable-the M &amp; M&#39;s-have the most to lose as they scramble to squash the release of the salacious tell-all Cheat Like a Lady, Don&#39;t Give a Damn.  Sable Alexandra&#39;s charmed life crashes and burns as alcohol and arrogance bring husband Price to his knees.  Cheaters and beaters don&#39;t mix, but an envious Bubbles Dupree craves all things Sable-including her husband.  Thirty-five-year-old Chunkie White clings to her virginity tighter than her disgust with life.  For lottery-loving Missionary Lilly White, the jig is up.  When a geriatric pimp resurfaces and threatens to topple the image she&#39;s spent decades to build, will she sacrifice her daughter&#39;s virtue to mute him?  With an obsession to expose Pastor David Dante&#39;s inferno, an impatient editor riding his back, and nothing else left to bank his roll, Reyn pens the noxious roman à clef Cheat Like a Lady, Don&#39;t Give a Damn.    Based loosely on the Seven Deadly Sins, Slippin&#39; Sippin&#39; Saints spotlights desperate souls wrestling with desire and vice as they seek salvation. From its jaw-dropping opener to its stunning climax, and unforgettable ending, this novel scratches the guiltiest itch, leaving readers breathlessly craving more.  Without being preachy, the provocative, refreshingly tongue-in-cheek Slippin&#39; Sippin&#39; Saints promises to entertain, redeem, and to restore the gift of hope." />
