  <title>When You Dance With The Devil - Gwynne Forster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&quot;A great story with wonderful life lessons .  .  ..&quot;&amp;#8212;Books 2 Mention Magazine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the death of her demanding mother, Sara Jolene Tilman is alone in the world for the first time&amp;#8212;and ready for a fresh start. Sara becomes Jolene, and moves into the Thank the Lord Boarding House, an oceanside sanctuary that houses eleven other &quot;misguided souls,&quot; as proprietress Fannie Johnson thinks of them. Surrounded by strangers, Jolene sees how socially awkward&amp;#8212;and lonely&amp;#8212;she really is. Yet, as she naively begins her search for love and belonging, Jolene finds she&#39;s not alone.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disillusioned by romance and success, wealthy Richard Peterson has given up his career and registered at Thank the Lord Boarding House. But he is taken aback by the humble surroundings, and the down-to-earth housemates for whom his status means nothing. Still, Richard discovers simple pleasures&amp;#8212;and a promising new relationship. Now, with a little help from Fannie, Jolene and Richard will struggle to find themselves&amp;#8212;and each other&amp;#8212;at last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Ms. Forster has given more than a story of redemption; it is a story that encompasses the growth of the inner-self, the cleansing of souls, and an exposure to a time that is strikingly old-fashioned. This story should appeal to the innocence in readers.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212;The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers&lt;/b&gt;" />
