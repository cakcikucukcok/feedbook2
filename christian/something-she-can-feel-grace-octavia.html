  <title>Something She Can Feel - Grace Octavia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;For a woman with her future all mapped out, life&#39;s about to go in a whole new direction.  .  .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tuscaloosa, Alabama, may not be glamorous, but for Journey Cash, the small Southern town has always been enough. She has a loving husband, a great family, and she brings the house down at church with her beautiful, thunderous singing voice. But Journey wonders if her years as an obedient preacher&#39;s daughter have kept her from living the life she is meant to live.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dame, one of her former students, comes to visit after striking it big as a rap star, Journey gets a taste of the fast-lane life that has passed her by. Dame is exciting, unpredictable, and sexy, and Journey is ready to trade in her seemingly perfect existence to simply feel one thing that&#39;s real. Soon, she finds herself running from everything in her world into the arms of Dame&amp;#8212;and the ride of her life.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;This wonderful book holds your attention from beginning to end. There are surprises at every turn, and no detail is left unexplained.  .  .This book will inspire you to take charge of your own life.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
