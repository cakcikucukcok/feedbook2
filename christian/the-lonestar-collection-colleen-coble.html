      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lonestar Sanctuary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though tragedy has wrecked her life, Allie Siders holds on to the hope that her five-year-old daughter, Betsy, will speak again. But with a stalker out for revenge, all Allie can think about now is their safety. She heads to the peaceful Bluebird Ranch, nestled in Texas hill country. Ranch owner Elijah DeAngelo eagerly welcomes the duo. But Rick Bailey&amp;mdash;the ranch foreman&amp;mdash;hasn&#39;t decided to let his guard down. Promises made long ago soon force Rick and Allie to work together to escape danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lonestar Secrets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon Astor returns to southwest Texas to serve as the town&#39;s veterinarian&amp;mdash;and to get her life back on track. Then she catches a glimpse of Jack MacGowan, the man who ruined her life years before. Even more shocking is the sight of Jack&#39;s five-year-old daughter Faith, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Shannon&#39;s own daughter Kylie. Could Faith be&amp;nbsp;the daughter that Shannon has believed to be dead for all these years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lonestar Homecoming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gracie Lister escapes with her daughter to the West Texas country where her family fell apart years ago. There, Lieutenant Michael Wayne gives Gracie the refuge she needs and a job caring for his two children. When Gracie&amp;rsquo;s ex-fianc&amp;eacute; catches up to her, her impulse is to flee the danger&amp;mdash;and the father she lacks the courage to confront. Together Gracie and Michael&amp;nbsp;must&amp;nbsp;find the strength they need in each other to protect their newly forged family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lonestar Angel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago Eden and Clay Larson&amp;rsquo;s baby was stolen and never found. The tragedy ended their young and rocky marriage. Now Eden&amp;rsquo;s moved to a new town to rebuild her life. But Clay arrives and delivers news: he never signed their divorce papers. And Clay has been searching for Brianna all this time. He believes he&amp;rsquo;s found her in Bluebird, Texas, at a youth ranch. All five little girls there are the right age. Eden and Clay sign on as counselors, but as danger closes in, Eden, Clay, and all their young charges are in jeopardy. As they fight to save their family, Eden realizes that God has been fighting for them all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All is Calm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bluebird Ranch is the perfect place for Lauren Everman to hide. As the witness to a murder, she needs protection and the ranch&amp;rsquo;s owners offer her sanctuary. She lends a hand with the foster kids who visit the ranch to learn how to ride horses. Little Carly is her first student. Brendan Waddell is recovering from a gunshot wound at Bluebird Ranch. His friends&amp;rsquo; welcoming home is the perfect place for him to rest during the holiday season. Lauren intrigues him, even though she says she&amp;rsquo;s not interested in romance. When Lauren and Brendan conspire to give young Carly a&amp;nbsp;happy Christmas, love blooms. But first the couple must race against time to find the killer before he strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
