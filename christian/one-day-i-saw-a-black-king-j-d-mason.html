  <title>One Day I Saw a Black King - J. D. Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;He stared at himself in the mirror, wondering how he&#39;d managed to lose track of time.  Complacency had managed to set in again. . . A decent job, warm home, food on the table, and a body to curl up next to at night; he&#39;d made the mistake of getting comfortable. Comfort fooled him into thinking it was all good when it wasn&#39;t.  Damn nightmares had a way of reminding him of that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since he was fifteen, John King has been on the run from the ghosts of his past, always drifting, never settling down in one place or with one woman, though more than one has certainly made the offer of forever-after.  But every time his memories of life back in Texas start to haunt him too deeply into the night, John realizes that it&#39;s time to move on.  That is, until he rolls into Denver, Colorado, grooving to Marvin Gaye&#39;s &quot;Let&#39;s Get It on,&quot; and meets Connie Rodgers, a woman who grew up on the mean streets and has the pain and the battle scars to prove it.  And yet, she inspires him to think &quot;If indeed there were a home for the perfect kiss, it would be on her lips.&quot;  John is reluctant to admit that here is a woman who just may understand his very soul, even if she does have some baggage of her own.  But both must face their pasts if they ever hope to be free to live and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with completely unforgettable characters, &lt;i&gt;One Day I Saw a Black King &lt;/i&gt;is a stunningly powerful story that explores the power of the past over the present, the search for love and belonging and the healing gift of an extraordinary love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
