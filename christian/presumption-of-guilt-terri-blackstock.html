  <title>Presumption of Guilt - Terri Blackstock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just one person can save the children from a terrifying future. But to do so, she must master her past. Beth Wright, a newspaper reporter, is hot on the trail of a story that could expose something very ugly at the St. Clair Children&amp;rsquo;s Home. Someone else is hot on Beth Wright&amp;rsquo;s trail&amp;mdash;someone who wants to make sure her story never sees the press. Between them stands Nick Hutchins, a social worker who finds his own gut hunches about the children&amp;rsquo;s home increasingly confirmed, first by Beth&amp;rsquo;s investigation . . . then by a high-speed attempt on her life . . . and finally, by an intruder&amp;rsquo;s startling confession. As the drama unfolds, a horrifying picture emerges of helpless children under the sway of a modern-day Fagin. Just one person holds the key that can save them: Beth herself. But using that key could cost Beth her reputation . . . if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t first cost her life. Presumption of Guilt is a gripping portrayal of the depths of human evil, the soul-twisting influence of lies . . . and of the liberating power of truth and the far-reaching freedom of God&amp;rsquo;s mercy and grace. Presumption of Guilt is book four in the Sun Coast Chronicles by award-winning author Terri Blackstock. From absorbing legal drama to lightning-paced action, the Sun Coast Chronicles offers suspense at its finest, tempered with remarkable realism and penetrating insights into the human heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
