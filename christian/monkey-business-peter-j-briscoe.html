The monkey is &amp;#39;mammon&amp;#39; who is constantly seeking to destroy our relationship with God and our neighbour!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book uses the parable of Jesus, told in Luke, chapter 16 and verses 1 to 15, called in many translations &amp;#39;The Unjust Steward.&amp;#39; This book will explan how his master called the steward &amp;#39;shrewd,&amp;#39; and how we can deal &amp;#39;shrewdly&amp;#39; with money in all&amp;nbsp;our daily affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter describes how the clever monkey tries to trick us in ignoring Gods ways and in using people instead of serving them. He&amp;nbsp;gives very practical ways in which to become shrewd managers of Gods resources, using money to benefit people, helping them to enjoy Gods Kingdom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does mammon affect our financial decisions?
