  <title>Brush of Angel&#39;s Wings - Ruth Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He doesn&amp;AElig;t plan to stay Amish. She doesn&amp;AElig;t have a plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then an angel draws their hearts toward God . . . and each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A buggy-racing champion, a hardworking field-hand, and a terrible cook, Rachel Hartzler does not fit her Amish community&amp;AElig;s standards for an eligible bride. Hurt by their rejection and still grieving the loss of her brother, Rachel is ready for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;AElig;s not, however, ready for Jordan Engles. Rachel&amp;AElig;s father hired him to help tend the fields so Rachel can learn to cook and sew, thus increasing her chances of finding a husband. She can&amp;AElig;t understand why her father doesn&amp;AElig;t want her help and blames Jordan for trying to replace her beloved brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan plans for his time on the Michigan farm to be short. Before his mother passed away, he promised her he&#39;d give her Amish roots a chance. Upon her death, uncertain about what else to do, he came to stay with his Uncle Isaac in Hope Falls. He&#39;s curious why his mother left the community she obviously loved. But it doesn&#39;t take Jordan long to conclude that the strict lifestyle and the three hour church services are not for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there isn&amp;AElig;t just human interaction at play.&amp;nbsp;Nathaniel, an angel of God, sees the potential in Jordan and Rachel&amp;AElig;s hearts from heaven&amp;AElig;s perspective. His goal is to shepherd them toward the path of healing and love. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tragedy strikes, then strikes again, this angelic being is sent to guide them toward the healing and abundant life promised in God&amp;AElig;s Word &amp;ucirc; if only they will listen.&lt;/p&gt;
