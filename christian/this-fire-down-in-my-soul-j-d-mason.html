  <title>This Fire Down in My Soul - J. D. Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Faylene Watkins begins counseling women of her husband&#39;s congregation at &lt;i&gt;Hope Filled Christian Center &lt;/i&gt;church, three women teach her the perils of love, sex and obsession. Choir girl Elise thinks she&#39;s found a good man in Jay, a truck driver who came blowing into her life one sultry night. Irresistible and sensual, he&#39;s caught up in romancing Elise. However, when she&#39;s ready for happily ever after, he realizes that he can&#39;t just walk away from his wife and two children. And Elise just can&#39;t seem to let him go. Everyone knows that singles ministry leader Renee is full of herself. When she starts her latest interior decorating project, she thinks her client&#39;s husband is hot, and together, they&#39;re on fire. Meanwhile his wife wants to be friends, and it&#39;s not long before a twisted game starts to unravel. For twenty-five years Tess&#39;s life revolved around her unfaithful husband (who sits on the deacon&#39;s board) and their two wonderful sons. But now the kids have left the nest and Tess wants to spread her wings. While busy seeking her first job and creating a new social life outside the church, Tess meets a new man--a most forbidden man--who rides into the picture to rock her world off its steady axis.  All the while, First Lady of the church and counselor, Faye is keeping a secret of her own that is much deeper than any one of them could ever imagine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
