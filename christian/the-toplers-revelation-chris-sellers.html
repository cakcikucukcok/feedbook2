  <title>The Toplers’ Revelation - Chris Sellers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Toplers Revelation series is about a strong Christian family living in a post-9/11 era.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Tom Topler has just moved his family to Columbus, Georgia, as he has been ordered to finalize the testing and proof-of-concept model of a new style of liquid body armor. The project is now in the final stages of testing before a live demonstration. It could change the tide in the ongoing war against terrorism in the Middle East and save a lot of lives.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman Stadnik, a former KGB/FSB agent from the old Soviet Union, has been hired by a Middle Eastern government to steal the technology for his Middle Eastern employer. In an unusual move, Roman has brought his family with him from Estonia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans daughter and Major Toplers daughter meet by chance at school. Their friendship complicates Romans mission and puts everyone in grave danger.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the Toplers as they share their faith and love of Jesus with everyone they meet. In the end, it will take all their faith to hold on to what they hold most dear. And the price for one may be more than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
