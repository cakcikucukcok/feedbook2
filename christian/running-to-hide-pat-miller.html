  <title>Running to Hide - Pat Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katherine Thomas has been running for nearly six years. She witnessed a double murder in Chicago. Somehow, the murderer found out that Katherine had witnessed the homicides and has been trying to catch up with her. The only ones who knew she was a witness are part of law enforcement agencies, leaving her with no one to trust. The stalker is never far behind as she tries to find a permanent place to hide.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Katherine decides to hide out in a small mountain community in Colorado and finds an old Victorian house to rent for the winter. Alex Hamilton owns the house, and hes a US Marshal. He knows his renter has secrets, but he has ways to find out what those secrets are.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountain town is strange with talk of Big Foot, tiny houses, preppers, and underground bunkers. Will Stony Creek be safe, or when her life is threatened, will the small community turn out to be the last place she will hide?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherine lives in constant fear that her past will catch up with her. Will her nightmare never end?&lt;/p&gt;" />
