  <title>The Seeing Eye - Samuel Hayes Sherwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why, O&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, do you stand&amp;nbsp;far away?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;do you hide yourself in&amp;nbsp;times of trouble? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ps 10:1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question that eludes an answer to so many. Where does the love of God go when evil seems to descend all around us like a bell jar? Carl Cook was given up by his birth mother. His adoptive mother was murdered. He was abused by his stepfather. He was failed by the justice system, dismissed by the school system, and neglected by the church. Abandoned and homeless, Carl stoically faces these hurdles alone. Or is he alone? When it seems things couldn&amp;#39;t get worse, they do. But then a new picture starts to form on the face of the deep and he realizes that maybe&amp;mdash; just maybe&amp;mdash;there was a purpose. Maybe God was there all along. He just needed to have eyes that see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single,&amp;nbsp;thy whole body shall be full of light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Matt 6:22)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book will appeal to readers from teenagers to senior seeking the answer that only a few like Joseph seemed to grasp&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;. . . you meant&amp;nbsp;evil&amp;nbsp;against me, but God meant it for&amp;nbsp;good, . . .&amp;quot; (Gen 50:20)&lt;/p&gt;" />
