  <title>Joyful - Shelley Shepard Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A young Amish couple gets a second chance at love in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Shelley Shepard Gray&amp;#8217;s final book in her Return to Sugarcreek series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randall Beiler is doing his best to put his family and the farm&amp;#8217;s needs first, even forsaking love. But though he tries, Randall knows he needs help caring for his younger siblings and keeping the house together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his brother offers pretty Elizabeth Nolt a job taking care of the house and cooking for the family, Randall is furious&amp;#8212;and guilty about the way he once broke Elizabeth&amp;#8217;s heart. But when he learns that Elizabeth and her grandmother are struggling to make ends meet, he knows the offer, no matter how painful, is the right thing for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth wants to refuse&amp;#8212;to stay far away from the man who hurt her&amp;#8212;but she needs the money. Though she vows to protect her heart, spending time in the Beiler household makes Elizabeth realize that, while she&amp;#8217;s older and wiser, her love for Randall still burns strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randal, too, seems to want something more. But does he want Elizabeth because he truly loves her&amp;#8212;or because he needs a housekeeper? If Randall sincerely wants something more, he must find a way to show Elizabeth&amp;#8212;or risk losing his chance at love forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joyful&lt;/em&gt; includes a P.S. section with a letter from the author, discussion questions, and a teaser from her next book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
