  <title>The Promise of Lumby - Gail Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;2017 Edition!&amp;nbsp; Book #4 of the Lumby series. What Garrison Keillor did for Lake Wobegon and Jan Karon did for Mitford, Gail Fraser has done for Lumby - a town so heartwarming and endearing, you&amp;#39;ll be forever transported. When their beloved veterinarian decides to retire, Lumby&amp;rsquo;s residents turn a curious eye to a stranger, Dr. Tom Candor, who steps up to the responsibilities, hangs his shingle and is soon embraced by the town. But when one distrusting journalist digs too deep and reveals Tom&amp;rsquo;s past, Lumby turns a cold back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only after Dr. Candor leaves with one of their most beloved residents do the townsfolk pause and consider the consequences of its actions: after all, who will care for Hank if he falls ill? While some residents concoct the wildest of schemes to charm the vet back&amp;mdash;a zoo at Montis Inn populated by the four-legged gifts from around the world&amp;mdash;others come to the aid of Pam and Mark Walker who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in Franklin, the monks of Saint Cross Abbey face their own temptations from an unexpected proposition by a group of religious vintners, the Sisters of St. Amand who have vine roots and cases of award-winning wine in tow. Come back to Lumby in this fourth novel of the acclaimed series!&lt;/p&gt;" />
