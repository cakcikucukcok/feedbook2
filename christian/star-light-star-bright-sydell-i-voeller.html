      <meta name="description" content="When Chyenna Dupres and her young daughter move from Portland, Oregon, to the small town of Prairie Valley, Chyenna leases a historic inn there. She plans to turn the inn into an upscale eatery, despite strong resistance from some of the locals. Her most vocal objector is cattle rancher Blair Westerman, who has relocated from L.A. to protect his own daughter from the &quot;evils&quot; of city life. More ever, he is determined to guard Prairie Valley from outside influences, especially tourists who might decide to stay. From the moment they first meet, Chyenna and Blair can&#39;t seem to leave each other alone. They get under each other&#39;s skin, and race through each other&#39;s thoughts. Their opposing goals for Prairie Valley and their push-pull feelings for each other keep tensions high--especially when their match-making daughters become close friends and decide to run away together." />
