  <title>The Book of Steven - Steven T. Stevenson, Shah R. Azad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine a humorous novel about a suicide who enters heaven and finds it not cosseting but a purgatory where lifes distractions (food, booze, sex, Internet) are removed and the hardest question looms: Why did he kill himself? Welcome to the journey of Steven, an unintentionally funny male whiner, panicker, quitter, porn addict, and general screwup, as he struggles with God, Jesus, and self to escape Heavens Suicide Ward and yet not return to the hell of earth. Reminiscent of Douglas Adams delightful Hitchhiker series, Stevenson and Azad play this dilemma for all its worth, creating ludicrous conversations that leave both Jesus and God mystified.
 US Review
If you happen to find yourself on a difficult path and truly need to find a new way to examine your life, The Book of Steven may help you discover hope where there appears to be none, and offers a unique perspective for examining the universe in which we all choose to participate. Stevens message is that you do not have to simply be content to live in a world of personal despair, when the possibilities presented by the universe of life are truly boundless.
Stevens journey is not an easy one to take, however, and for those of you who may not need to explore alternative perspectives for our world  or lack the stomach to bear witness to Stevens saga  you may want to devote your attention elsewhere." />
