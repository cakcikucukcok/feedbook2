Angus Camerons godly counsel, however, has prevented this outward imperfection from twisting his daughters sense of self-worth. She believes the mark on her face is Gods way of marking her for special blessing. 
When God leads Lily to the love of her life it is only to discover he has a blemish on his soul. Rick Anderson, has spent seven years in prison for vehicular manslaughter and is weighed down with guilt and regret. He is unable to forgive himself for his part in the death of an entire family, nor can he believe in Gods forgiveness. Besides this there is an enemy lurking in the background intent on their destruction. 
Will they crumble under the human and supernatural forces arrayed against them? Or will a faithful band of prayer-warriors cause them to finally triumph?" />
