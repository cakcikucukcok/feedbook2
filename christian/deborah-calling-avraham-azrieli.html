  <title>Deborah Calling - Avraham Azrieli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author of the bestselling &lt;em&gt;Deborah Rising&lt;/em&gt; continues the fascinating story of the Biblical prophetess Deborah in this entrancing work of visionary fiction&amp;#8212;a tale of danger, mysticism, intrigue, and daring for fans of &lt;em&gt;The Red Tent, The Mists of Avalon,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deborah&amp;#8217;s father dreamed that, one day, she would become a prophet&amp;#8212;a seemingly impossible dream for a woman in a patriarchal society. To see her father&amp;#8217;s dream come true, Deborah made the cunning decision to become a man and sought out a mysterious elixirist who can turn women into men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the elixirist Kassite&amp;#8217;s tutelage and training, Deborah learns the essential traits of masculinity and steadily grows stronger, building muscle and willpower. But Kassite requests something in return: he needs Deborah&#39;s help to escape the tannery and return to his homeland. It is the beginning of another thrilling adventure through the desert&amp;#8212;a cat and mouse chase between Deborah and her violent fianc&amp;#233; who still hunts her, a chance meeting with an ancient healer with a prophetic message, and a revelatory spiritual experience in an abandoned cave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she continues on the path God has laid before her, Deborah witnesses the darkness that can take hold in the hearts and souls of men&amp;#8212;evil that causes her to reflect on the wisdom, insight, and inspiration she has gained from the women in her life. Will becoming a man truly help her become a prophetess, or might there be another path? Visionary dreams, a mysterious eagle, and an extraordinary band of ex-slaves will help Deborah find the answer . . . and ultimately her calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A riveting adventure tale derived from traditional biblical fiction, &lt;em&gt;Deborah Calling&lt;/em&gt; imagines the life of one of the most famous figures from the Old Testament as she continues on her path to becoming a prophet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
