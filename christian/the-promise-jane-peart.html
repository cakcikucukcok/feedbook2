  <title>The Promise - Jane  Peart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She was of American blood, born in the islands. He was a native islander. Their love bridged two worlds that would one day threaten to tear them apart. As a child, Jana Rutherford played barefoot on the sparkling Hawaiian beaches with her friend, Akela, and Akela&#39;s handsome cousin, Kimo. But that carefreeness would change as Jana grew...and the quality of her and Kimo&#39;s friendship grew as well into something deeper, stronger. It was then that Jana first heard the whispers, &quot;He&#39;s not her kind&quot; -and discovered the differences people drew between a Hawaiian-born American and a native islander. Faced with the ignorance of others and a painful time of separation from Imo, it would be easy for Jana&#39;s love to grow cold. Especially with Bayard, the dashing brother of Jana&#39;s wealthy friend, Edith, showing such evident interest. Attractive, charming, and of American stock like herself, Bayard represented a lavish, exciting world that Jana had only read about. But Kimo stood for all she had known and loved. In each intricate quilt of the Hawaiian women, a secret was hidden known only to its creator, a story contained in its design. Jana&#39;s life seemed much like a quilt: delicately yet passionately fashioned by a Creator who knew how to assemble the pieces into a mysterious, glorious pattern- a life&#39;s tale yet untold.&lt;/p&gt;" />
