  <title>September Song - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The enthralling third novel in the chronicle of the O&#39;Malleys in the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth of the O&#39;Malley chronicles is narrated by the ravishing Rosemarie, dedicated wife of our intrepid and trouble-prone hero, Chucky Cronin O&#39;Malley. Destined to be compared to the Lanny Budd novels of Upton Sinclair and the Chicago novels of James T. Farrell, &lt;i&gt;September Song&lt;/i&gt; follows the crazy O&#39;Malley saga from Chucky&#39;s appointment as Ambassador to Germany by President Kennedy (the youngest Ambassador in history), to his resignation over his violent disagreement with President Johnson, to his in-your-face involvement in Selma, Alabama, the Chicago Democratic Convention, and the Vietnam War.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chucky can&#39;t stay out of trouble, and his loving and devoted wife Rosemarie is often, if not always, by his side. Raising a family and showing up at the hot trouble spots of the world seems to be Chucky&#39;s destiny. Greeley recalls the turbulent and history changing events of the 1960s with fondness and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
