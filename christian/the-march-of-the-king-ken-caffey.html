  <title>The March of the King - Ken Caffey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;King Alez, a beloved ruler of the kingdom of Castlemyer, is a man strong in his faith, deep in his convictions, and generous with his compassion. Unfortunately, his half-brother, Dator, does not share the same traits and is preparing to carry out an evil plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dator is hatching a plot to kill King Alez so that he can step up to the throne. With help from a false holy man, Dator tricks his brother, leaves him for dead, claims the throne, and begins a reign of terror. But what he does not know is that King Alez is still alive, thanks to the Lord who sent dwarves to his rescue. Now as the king travels to reclaim his crown, the Lord brings animals, dwarves, elves, men and women, and legends to life to aid him in his quest. But as he continues a magical journey that epitomizes the power of faith, King Alez is unaware that other enemies are hiding in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to pounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Christian fantasy tale, after a king is tricked by his brother and left for dead he recruits both humans and magical creatures to help him on his march to reclaim his throne.&lt;/p&gt;" />
