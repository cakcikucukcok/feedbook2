  <title>The Unknown Disciple - Michael L. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what it would have been like to walk and talk with the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? This book, &quot;The Unknown Disciple,&quot; leads you on a a journey to the manger where Jesus lay as a new born babe, and then follows the life of one of the unknown shepherds as he comes to the know the Savior throughout his life. Taken from the pages of the King James New Testament, this book uses the actual events and words of Jesus Christ to create a historical fiction that places the reader in some of the most memorable events from the lives of those who traveled with Jesus during his ministry. Wound tightly into the stories are principles of faith, hope, love, and service that lift the reader to an understanding of the Lord&#39;s gospel from an intimate personal perspective. As one reads the accounts taken from actual events that occurred in the New Testament, one is enveloped in the Spirit of God as one sees and feels as those who walked among him must have felt as they witnessed the healings and the miracles of Jesus. You will feel what it was like to walk upon the water, eat of the bread he offered to the 5,000 and feel the heartache and tragedy of Gethsemane and Golgotha. More than anything, you will feel the infinite love of the Savior for each of his disciples. You will experience the joy of his glorious resurrection and gain a stronger witness that Jesus is the very Christ, the Son of God, and Savior of the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
