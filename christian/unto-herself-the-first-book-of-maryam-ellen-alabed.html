  <title>Unto Herself, The First Book of Maryam - Ellen Alabed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;This Christian Fiction Novel is Factually Brilliant&amp;mdash;Yet Riddled with daring, raw, gripping emotion and fraught with intents of mediumship and the occult&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a beautifully composed work of Christian Science Fiction that allows us to see Mary, the mother of Jesus, as never before as she journeys to discover her strongest pathway to power in a way that&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed to keep your eyes glued to the page at every turn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one female is mentioned by name in the entire Quran. Catholics say the Hail Mary prayer ten times more often than the Our Father. But why? The Church has disguised Mary as a silent, unwitting pawn and grieving mother. But who was she really and what was her true role in the redemption theory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you loved spiritual fiction or psychic medium books like The Red Tent, Francine Rivers Lineage of Grace, The Shack, or other controversial New Age Religious Fiction, you&amp;rsquo;ll love Unto Herself, The First Book of Maryam.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And so this masterpiece of New Age Fiction Meets Christian Fiction begins&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoned shortly before marrying her betrothed for false allegations of fornication, Salome&amp;mdash;untouched by man, yet secretly concealing an immaculately conceived child&amp;mdash;whispers her dying words to her betrothed Yuseph&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You will foster the child. You will be his father.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unequipped to raise a child Yuseph seeks out the guidance of Benyat, the temple priest who wills the child to barren couple Ann and Joaquim of the House of David&amp;mdash;future aunt and uncle of John the Baptist&amp;mdash;who vow to keep the baby&amp;rsquo;s birth circumstances secret and raise Maryam as their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did they know Maryam (Mary), the mother of Yesuah (Jesus), possesses spiritual, healing, and psychic gifts that could rock the world at its very core&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even with the encouragement of Benyat, proper training and even dressing like a man&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take long for Maryam to realize that society&amp;rsquo;s ignorance will never allow her to unleash the powers she carries as a medium, healer, and clairvoyant who can channel automatic writing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not until her own immaculate conception, and continued romantic feelings for Yuseph, that Maryam realizes not all hope is lost&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Maryam as a woman cannot live out her dreams of service, society may accept Yesuah&amp;mdash;if only he is truly the messiah she and Beynat foresaw&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is&amp;hellip;will their secret remain veiled long enough for Maryam to train Yesuah to properly unleash his powers for good- to perform his miracles and instill a simple, unencumbered faith in world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryam- the master, and Yesuah- her apprentice...together they will change the course of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or will the danger around every corner cut all their lives short in a way you&amp;rsquo;ve never imagined&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
