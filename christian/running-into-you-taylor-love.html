  <title>Running Into You - Taylor Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Andrea Cole is a career woman who has it all except romance. Her excuses range from she&amp;rsquo;s too busy, men are too crazy and dating is to emotionally hard! She also believes love should work on her schedule, but destiny has other plans when she literally runs into Cam. If those golden brown eyes were not enough to have her rethinking, then the spark of electricity when they touch definitely did! Will she let chemistry knock down the defenses of her heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cam &amp;ldquo;Camden&amp;rdquo; Holden, likes his life just the way it is. He has a job he enjoys and a house he loves in his childhood city. So what if it&amp;rsquo;s empty when he lays his head down at night. His dating life remains casual, but he&amp;rsquo;s open to meeting &amp;ldquo;the one&amp;rdquo; to make him take love seriously. Fate may have been kind to him when pretty eyed Andrea literally bumps into him on the street. Will he be able to lure in the wary Ms. Cole&amp;hellip;so he can make his house a home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
