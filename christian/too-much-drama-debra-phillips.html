  <title>Too Much Drama - Debra Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Contemporary fans will enjoy this humorous tale.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Midwest Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donneeka LeBeau is a smart, beautiful, and intelligent woman. An executive at the high-profile Diva Four Cosmetics company, Donneeka certainly does not need a matchmaker, especially if that matchmaker is her mother! However, Adeena LeBeau is used to getting what she wants. And right now, she wants to set her daughter up with the perfect man. That&#39;s Braxton Dupree, the most eligible bachelor in town. Even though Donneeka tries her hardest to ignore Braxton&#39;s advances, she can&#39;t help but fall in love. Not wanting to let her mother win at the matchmaking game, Donneeka keeps her affair with Braxton a secret. This isn&#39;t easy, especially with Donneeka&#39;s hilariously meddlesome sisters around! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the ultimate player decides that he wants commitment too, Donneeka must face up to her mother and admit that sometimes lovin&#39; from a great man really is as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
