      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gods love shines through Ellens excitement as she dons the red dress won from the Bridal Shoppe. Daniel has invited all the ladies to attend Hutsons Ball, but excitement dims as she recalls the animosity between their new neighbors Marigold and Harriet. While Annes ex-husband tries to ruin her life, Bitty is miserable because she and the chief of police have called it quits. But Ellen knows hearts are changing thanks to the work of the Holy Spirit. In spite of the womens resolve to remain aloof, Ellen has faith Jesus can save them and God will keep them. If they could call a truce for one night and enjoy the ball, Ellen would be happy, but what happens is inevitable. Andrew shows up in a drunken stupor and confronts Anne about their son. From there it all becomes interesting as Harriet asserts authority and Bitty is stunned to see another woman on the arm of the chief of police. When Daniel is encountered by Madonna, his old girlfriend, Ellen knows no matter what happens God has a plan for each person. All the elements of Gods grace and forgiveness are seen in Forbidden through the changing of each of these womens lives. One by one, Ellen knows the Lord will break them downshe only prays that He will do it gently.&lt;/p&gt;" />
