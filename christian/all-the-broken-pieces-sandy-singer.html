  <title>All the Broken Pieces - Sandy Singer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An adoring husband, two cherished stepdaughters, and a cozy cottage by the sealife seems perfect. More perfect than Grace Will deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Grace marries Adam, a widower with two young daughters, she carries the broken pieces of a hidden and disgraceful past. It soon becomes evident that Adam is also bound by his past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prowler threatens, and Adam hires someone to live on property and watch over his family when he is away. To Graces horror, the man hired is Derrickthe one person who knows each detail of her secret past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in fear that her secret will be revealed, problems intensify. Grace makes frequent plans to tell Adam the truth, but her plans all fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a hurricane forms just miles from their island home, Grace must take refuge against the storm, the sinister plans Derrick has harbored all along. Believing Gods promises are not for her, Grace makes an agonizing decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will a forgotten letter persuade her to change her mind, or will she hold to her decision to run from Gods promises and a love shes been unable to fully grasp?&lt;/p&gt;" />
