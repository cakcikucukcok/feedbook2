&lt;p&gt;In her book, His Treasure: A McGregor Novel, author M. Lyn Walker takes readers to Morgans hometown and on her journey of self-discovery. There she meets fifteen-year-old Petra McDonald. Her widowed father, Jacob McDonald, struggles with Petras rebellion, and he sends her to his mother for the summer so that she can sort out Petras problems. As a favor to the girls grandmother, Morgan agrees to become Petras companion. But her scandalous past forces Jacob to make a terrible decision that propels his daughter into danger. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-held secrets come to light in His Treasure: A McGregor Novel as Pastor Deon of New Life Full Gospel Church helps his followers understand prides destructive power, and that healing begins with repentance and self-forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
