  <title>Hidden in the Shadows - C. D. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katherine Smith is a strong, independent woman, raised by her grandparents in East Texas. Her upbringing allowed her to be a loving and outgoing young woman with a blessed life. Katherines life is shaken after she is attacked one night in her apartment. Horrible nightmares from this ordeal trigger traumatic memories from her past; a past that she didnt know existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming friends with Derrick Leaman, the handsome officer investigating her case, seems both a blessing and a conflict in her life. As Katherine tries to understand her past and heal from her attack, her growing feelings for Derrick add to her already complicated life. And just when she hoped her life wouldnt endure any more trials and tribulations, her attacker returns late one dark night to finish what theyve started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherines faith and trust in God will give her strength to overcome her past, courage to trust in love, and protection from unseen dangers hidden in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;" />
