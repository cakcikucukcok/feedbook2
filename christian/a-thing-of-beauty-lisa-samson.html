  <title>A Thing of Beauty - Lisa Samson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a wonder to behold what happens when love moves in . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former child star Fiona Hume deserted the movie biz a decade ago&amp;mdash;right after she left rehab. She landed in Baltimore, bought a dilapidated old mansion downtown, and hatched dreams of restoring it into a masterpiece, complete with a studio for herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She would disappear from public view and live an artist&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, Fiona&amp;rsquo;s huge house is filled with junk purchased at thrift stores, haggled over at yard sales, or picked up from the side of the road. Each piece was destined for an art project . . . but all she&amp;rsquo;s got so far is a piece of twine with some antique buttons threaded down its length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s thirty-two years old and still recognizable, but Fiona&amp;rsquo;s money has finally run out. She&amp;rsquo;s gotten pretty desperate, too, and in her desperation she&amp;rsquo;s willing to do almost anything for money. Almost. So it is that she comes to rent out the maid&amp;rsquo;s quarters to a local blacksmith named Josia Yeu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josia is everything Fiona isn&amp;rsquo;t: gregarious, peaceful, in control without controlling . . . in short, happy. As the light from the maid&amp;rsquo;s quarters begins to permeate the dank rooms of Fiona&amp;rsquo;s world, something else begins to transform as well&amp;mdash;something inside Fiona. Something even she can see is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
