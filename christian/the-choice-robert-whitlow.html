      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;One young woman. Two very different roads. The choice will change everything.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Even as a pregnant, unwed teen in 1974, Sandy Lincoln wanted to do the right thing. But when an ageless woman approached her in a convenience store with a mysterious prophecy and a warning, doing the right thing became even more unclear.
