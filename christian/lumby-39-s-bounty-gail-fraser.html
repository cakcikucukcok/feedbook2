  <title>Lumby&#39;s Bounty - Gail Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;2017 Edition! Book #3 of the Lumby series. What Garrison Keillor did for Lake Wobegon and Jan Karon did for Mitford, Gail Fraser has done for Lumby - a town so heartwarming and endearing, you&amp;#39;ll be forever transported. Tucked into the foothills of the Rockies lies the charming village of Lumby, where quirky but tolerant townsfolk usually make the best of any situation. How Lumby has come to host a hot-air balloon festival is a long story (thanks to a couple of bored teenage entrepreneurs seeking some adventure), but the town&amp;#39;s residents embrace their responsibilities and jump right into the preparations. And the monks of St. Cross Abbey bring a visitor from a distant land to help solve Lumby&amp;rsquo;s one seemingly insurmountable challenge: to build and crew the lead balloon in the festival. After trial balloons wreck humorous mayhem across the county, Kai Talin and the mayor&amp;rsquo;s unassuming wife join forces and soon have The Bounty floating gently above the fairgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Pam and Mark Walker lend a hand while juggling their own challenges at Montis Inn, love grows between Kai and the daughter of the town matriarch. But can the improbable relationship survive? And can Hank overcome his acrophobia&amp;mdash;after all, for a pink flamingo who believes he&amp;#39;s a bald eagle, it would be an embarrassment if he didn&amp;rsquo;t ride along on The Bounty&amp;rsquo;s maiden voyage? In true Lumby tradition, blue skies and smooth sailing are always expected but not always guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
