  <title>Kill Shot - Susan Sleeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Suspense and romance combine in Susan Sleeman&#39;s thrilling new novel about an FBI agent who must team up with a beautiful therapist to stop a killer with a deadly new weapon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some fears haunt you forever....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the ballistics and weapon&#39;s expert for the FBI&#39;s special task force nicknamed the White Knights, Rick Cannon has known the Department of Defense was developing self-steering bullets. Rick feared these smart bullets--which have one hundred percent accuracy that can turn even a novice into a lethal sniper--would eventually end up  in the hands of the wrong people. But since the ammunition was still in the development stage, he figured they had plenty of time before that happened. He was wrong. Dead wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Until they become reality.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a homeless vet is killed with a smart bullet, it&#39;s clear that the ammunition has been stolen, and the Knights are called in to find the thief and stop the killings. But they aren&#39;t the only ones desperate to find the killer. Therapist Olivia Dobbs is well known for her success in counseling military veterans with PTSD. When she discovers one of her clients moments after he is murdered, she becomes both the FBI&#39;s prime witness, and suspect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the mutual attraction that immediately sparks between them, Rick can&#39;t--no he won&#39;t--let Olivia interfere with his investigation. But when the sniper trains his rifle on her, Rick must recall all the skills he learned as a Marine sniper to make sure the next bullet fired isn&#39;t a kill shot that takes Olivia out." />
