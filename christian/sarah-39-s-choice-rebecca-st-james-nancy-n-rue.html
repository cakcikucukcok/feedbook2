  <title>Sarah&#39;s Choice - Rebecca St. James, Nancy N. Rue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Sarah Collins&amp;rsquo;s mind, only one thing stands in the way of her success . . . an unborn baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah is about to receive a promotion that will give her everything she&amp;rsquo;s ever wanted: a huge pay increase, a new car, a fabulous apartment, and first-class travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then she discovers she&amp;rsquo;s pregnant. And while she &lt;em&gt;thinks &lt;/em&gt;she loves her boyfriend, Matt, she isn&amp;rsquo;t sure he&amp;rsquo;s mature enough to be a responsible father. And the job she&amp;rsquo;s pursuing is open only because the previous employee is out on maternity leave. Sarah would never be able to handle the travel as a single mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torn between advice from her coworkers, the insistence of her mother and sister that she keep the baby, her insecurity about her relationship with Matt, and the void where her father should be, Sarah has no idea how to make this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Christmas card from a mysterious old woman is the catalyst for three visions of her future&amp;mdash;and just may be the miracle she needs. But can she trust the visions? Are they the yearnings of a conflicted heart? Or are they true visions from the God she thought had turned His back on her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every woman who has made painful decisions, &lt;em&gt;Sarah&amp;rsquo;s Choice &lt;/em&gt;offers comfort, wisdom and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This story provides a bit of encouragement and hope to those facing a difficult decision.&quot; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;, 4-star review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A thought-provoking and stirring story of painful choices and their ramifications. For any woman who has had to make a difficult decision, this book . . . will provide inspiration, hope, and solace to battered souls.&quot; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ibrary Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Written with deep compassion, gentle humor, and incredible insight.&quot; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;CBA Retailers + Resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
