  <title>My Secrets Your Lies - N&#39;Tyse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I became the pariah. It was my punishment for walking in my truth and&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;being unafraid to love my way. But I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder what would have happened&amp;hellip;had I denied those feelings&amp;hellip;had I kept pretending&amp;hellip;had I&amp;hellip;stopped being me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo; &lt;b&gt;&amp;#8213;Sand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; Given all that Sand and Rene have been through, the couple lands an opportunity to share their life story in the upcoming documentary, &lt;i&gt;Beneath My Skin&lt;/i&gt;. The question is&amp;#8213;are they truly ready to take that trip down memory lane? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they subconsciously relive their past, Sand ventures to a dark place where agony and judgement has tormented her since the day her parents discovered her sexual orientation in a shoebox full of love letters. Their rejection left her homeless and dependent on the streets, but it was during those trying times that she learned how to not only walk in her truth, but how to survive.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recycled through the foster system as early as four, Rene is one who has become accustomed to change. Sand introduces her to another side of love and gives her a reason to open her mind and heart to something new&amp;#8213;that is, until Rene finds herself questioning not only their relationship, but her sexuality. A series of events leaves them entangled in a web of deceit, wicked passion, and murder. As their love story unfolds, they&amp;rsquo;ll find out soon enough if they are truly each other&amp;rsquo;s ride or die!" />
