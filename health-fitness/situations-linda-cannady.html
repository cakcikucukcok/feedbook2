  <title>Situations - Linda Cannady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was wrote, with a sense of urgency,  to prompt those who are in an, abusive relationship.
And to alert those who may be heading in that direction. Get out of it, save money and have an
escape plan, dont wait on the worst to happen, because once you go back, the situation gets
worst, and you may say to your self, that no one could be that cruel, but the best of them can
and will.  Because no matter how good you look, how good you make love, the fact that your
a good working person, or how much money you have, the problem comes from within them.
it could be the way they were raised, or a mental problem from birth, or both. So my advice is,
never get in a relationship with someone to cover the pain, from a previous relationship, 
because you will be blinded of their faults, until its to late.  Plus even bandages ware out and
fall, and if you ware a bandage to long, it makes your skin pale, so never put a bandage (which
is that new person, coming in your life) on your pain in your heart, but let it air out, meaning
stay single until you are sure the wound is completely healed.  Use that time to get back to
number one, you! And see what you want to do in life on you own, and then and only then will
you be able to see a person for who they really are.
