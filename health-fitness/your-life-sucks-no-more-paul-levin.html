      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What do you do, when things in your life, must change? &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
What do you do, when you are so fed up with the way things are? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can give up and pick up apathy, loss of hope and despair.&amp;nbsp; Or you can demand of the universe your birthright &amp;ndash; a happy, joy filled life.&amp;nbsp; A life where you are the master of your experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what happened to me.&amp;nbsp; I got to the point in my life, where enough was enough.&amp;nbsp; I was 53. Most of my life I settled for the crumbs.&amp;nbsp; It was time that I sat at the table and had the lobster. But how?&amp;nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s only for the lucky, the special, the chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, to my surprise, I learned that the universe has rules!&amp;nbsp; When we learn and experience the rules, things in life fall into place.&amp;nbsp; Decades of being an electrical engineer were paying off.&amp;nbsp; I reverse engineered the universe.&amp;nbsp; As soon as I did, I found I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first.&amp;nbsp; In fact, these truths have been around &amp;hellip;. forever. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to share with you, my experiences with these truths. And the miraculous changes they have brought about in my life.&amp;nbsp; As I share the things that I have discovered, it is my deepest desire that these truths and the change they bring, will become alive in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
