  <title>Facing the Tiger - Suzanne Chambers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prostate cancer is now the most common male cancer in the western world, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. In the United States over 2.5 million men are living with a diagnosis of prostate cancer; in the UK over 250,000 men, and in Australia over 120,000 men. For each man who has had prostate cancer, there will be people close who care about them, and love them, who are also deeply affected. This book provides practical strategies to help cope with the emotional and psychological stress of living with prostate cancer and to regain a sense of ease about the situation in which you may find yourself. Written by one of the world’s leading researchers into the psychological effects of cancer and how best to provide support for individuals and couples, it is structured so that the reader can choose whatever chapter seems most relevant right now. Personal stories and insights from men and their partners offer emotional comfort and inspiration throughout. While everyone’s experience of prostate cancer is uniquely their own there is nothing quite like the wisdom that comes from others who have already walked the path." />
