  <title>The Twelve Greatest Gifts We Give Our Children: How to Be the Mom Your Children Truly Need and Create the Family You Always Wanted - Trudi Mitchell Bartow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There&#39;s no getting around it: The most important person in a child&#39;s life is his or her mother. But many mothers feel overwhelmed and unsure of their decisions. They ask themselves questions such as: Am I raising my child to have good values? Am I teaching my child to be responsible? Will my child have faith?   Drawing on her experiences with her three children, the author shares lessons such as:  The words &quot;I love you&quot; mean something special to your child. Every child deserves to hear those words. Take time to have conversations with your children; find out what they are thinking, feeling, and wondering.  Love your children&#39;s personality traits even when they&#39;re different from your own.   With advice such as this, you&#39;ll learn how to give children great gifts, including the gift of intrinsic motivation; the gift of rules, structure and discipline; the gift of responsibility; the gift of goals and work ethic; the gift of family traditions; and the gift of open dialogue." />
