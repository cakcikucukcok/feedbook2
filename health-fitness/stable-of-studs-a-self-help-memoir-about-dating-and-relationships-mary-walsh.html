  <title>Stable of Studs: A Self-help Memoir About Dating and Relationships - Mary Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Attention Single Ladies! Read this self-help memoir to quickly weed through the wrong men and find the right guy for you. You&#39;ll find no-nonsense advice about online dating, successful first dates, effectively asking the guy for his last name (to make sure he doesn&#39;t have a criminal record!), and learning that sex is an ace to hold.
Stable of Studs is a self-help memoir about my dating and relationship escapades. The old saying goes, “Write what you know…” I ponder the mysteries of why men disappear after chatting for three weeks and face the awkward realities of encountering an ex with a new girlfriend. I give no-nonsense tips and lessons for what and what not to do on a first date, the mature way to break up, staying safe in a tech-centric world, learning that sex is an ace to hold, misadventures in online dating, and what kind of man is the best match on the path to finding the man for me, while interjecting humor from my worst date and being stood up.  
Do I eventually find The One?" />
