  <title>Free Mother to Good Home - Kay Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the words, I never dared to treat my parents the way kids do today? If you are a baby boomer or the parent of a tween, teen, or adult child, not only have you heard those words, you may have uttered them yourself. If, in this new age of childparent relations, youve ever felt like a helpless puppy or kitten inside a box marked Free to Good Home,if, in spite of all your love and the care with which you embraced parenting, your child has grown into an entitled and thoughtless power broker in your relationshipread on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Kay Taylor has studied sociology, parenting, blended families and personal growth for years; in this bold, groundbreaking book she explores the changes in our culture that she believes have given birth to what she describes as the E-generationa generation of teens and young adults that feel so empowered and entitled that they often clash with their parents, creating a palpable power struggle within the family. This often leaves good parents alone, depressed, and completely befuddled as to what they did wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free Mother to Good Home&lt;/em&gt; comes from the heart and experiences of an everyday parent in the trenches. Taylor offers a mothers perspective, as well as a remedy for parental blues, helping parents know what they can do to get their houses and their lives back in order.&lt;/p&gt;" />
