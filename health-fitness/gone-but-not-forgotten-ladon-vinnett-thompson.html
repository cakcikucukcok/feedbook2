  <title>“Gone, but Not Forgotten” - LaDon Vinnett-Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book pays tribute to my father, Alvin Charles Copeland, Sr.  My father was a great man with a great heart for people.  He loved life and winning in life.  He was successful because he prioritized people and family over materialistic things.  He was a winner that lived for a challenge.  As the eldest son, I am proud and humbled to have the opportunity to continue his legacy and fulfill the tasks he left behind.  I am honored to endorse this book as a motivational tool for anyone who may be facing a challenge, setback, or obstacle in this life.  My father never gave up on life in spite of disappointments; he was relentless about making the best of any situation. During his battle with cancer, my father never gave up.  He was a born leader, motivating father, and a man of influence.  As you read the pages of this book, I know you will be encouraged to live your life to the fullest.  I know that something in my fathers life will help motivate you to face every circumstance, or setback with a winning attitude.  Today I challenge you to take on the attitude of a champion.  Champions are determined risk-takers that are often the center of attraction.  Champions never die; they just live out their lives through others once they pass away.  Thank you for helping me pay tribute to a true champion, Al Copeland, Sr." />
