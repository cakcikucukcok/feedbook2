  <title>Chick Flicks Lie - Holly Marie Tong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I cherish the fun times/laughs I have with my friend/publicist Holly, who is always so Jolley. Just being in her presence makes me feel comfortable and at home - like Ive known her a million years. I know her readers are going to feel the same. The way she words and writes things is in such a smart, but understanding way, no matter the age or the maturity level - it always leaves you wanting more. 
Paul Jolley (American Idol - Season 12, Top 9 Finalist) 
Holly writes truthful and sincere. I know her writing comes from her heart and her experiences just from knowing her. She was the first one to write up an article about me and my hometown. Very excellent writer. Emm Hmmm. 
Duck Dynastys Mountain Man 
Are you tired of How-to dating books? Well, this is not one of them. Holly Marie Tongs Chick Flicks Lie (Sugar-free Accounts of a Positive Pessimist) features laughable and engaging stories which are relative of todays dating world. 
Deep down, we all want the kind of love that would chase our departing plane down the tarmac and the kind of love that would try to win us back no matter what the cost. However, real life is often a far cry from a chick flick, and there isnt any background music to accompany it. 
With sharp wit, continual sarcasm, and non-stop humor, Chick Flicks Lie reminds the single crowd that they arent alone. The empathetic author believes faith mixed with laughter to be the best medicine for lousy dates and failed relationships. This feel-good book will leave singles feeling understood, while giving them a whole new perspective." />
