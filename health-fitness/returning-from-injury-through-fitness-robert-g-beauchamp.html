  <title>Returning from Injury Through Fitness - Robert G. Beauchamp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Robert G. Beauchamp, Ph.D., fell in May 2015, he knew hed done some major damage.
The ligament he tore in his right knee controlled motion, which meant hed need to undergo surgery and participate in a rehabilitation program to regain abilities hed lost.
It wasnt the first time hed suffered an accident, however, and he knew that engaging in regular and vigorous exercise was the best option to regain his quality of life. In this memoir, he shares how to:
	achieve an improved quality of life and enhanced health via exercise;
	find renewed energy by focusing on physical fitness;
	cope with divorce, illness, and other problems by being more active; and
	approach physical fitness as a lifetime commitment.
No matter how old you are or what challenges you face, you can transform your health and well-being by focusing on physical fitness. Motivate yourself to get in shape, and challenge yourself to withstand the discomfort that goes along with Returning from Injury through Fitness." />
