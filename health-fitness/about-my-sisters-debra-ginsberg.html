  <title>About My Sisters - Debra Ginsberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the heels of her poignant and critically acclaimed memoirs, &lt;em&gt;Waiting&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Raising Blaze&lt;/em&gt;, Debra Ginsberg explores the unique connection she shares with her three sisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;About My Sisters&lt;/em&gt;, Ginsberg examines the special bond she shares with her three sisters, May, Lavander and Deja. As her hippie parents criss-crossed the globe, Debra, the oldest of five children, formed indelible bonds with her three sisters that last to this day. Separated by fifteen years among them, Debra and her sisters represent two different generations, each one of them having something to teach the other. Debra and Maya (the next oldest) became not only babysitters, but also playmates, problem solvers, teachers and surrogate mothers to the youngest two. And the shared experience of being the children of an unconventional, dope-smoking, non-career oriented, nomadic couple bonded them even more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured around the course of one year, &lt;em&gt;About My Sisters&lt;/em&gt; examines these bonds through the prism of the events of that year, revealing not only a &quot;different&quot; family, but also a unique and amazing relationship that has weathered many storms but never foundered. The four sisters (as well as their parents and brother) still live within ten miles of one another and share meals, holidays, joys, pains, and babysitting duties with an astounding frequency. This is a heart-warming, funny, and poignant look at a family that&#39;s much like the one we all wish we had..&lt;/p&gt;" />
