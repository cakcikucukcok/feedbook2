  <title>Strength Training - Cris Caivano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;A thorough and well-illustrated guide that makes strength training seem (gasp!) fun.&quot; &amp;#8212; &lt;I&gt;Bookpage &lt;BR&gt;Strength Training: Staying Fit and Fabulous&lt;/I&gt; holds the key to feeling and looking great at every stage in life. Although everyone loses muscle mass with age, much of this decline is due to disuse and can be repaired and even improved by practicing these targeted exercises. Exercise and movement therapist D. Cristine Caivano draws upon her years of expertise to provide a step-by-step guide to increasing flexibility and resilience regardless of your starting point. Eighty exercises feature 350 photographs illustrating each pose. &lt;BR&gt;Whether you are recovering from an injury or surgery, hoping to alleviate specific problems such as back pain or creaky knees, or simply attempting to maintain your fitness with tailored nutritional and exercise advice, this blend of methods from yoga, Pilates, tai chi, and other disciplines will help you achieve your goals.&lt;BR&gt;&quot;A rapidly growing senior population needs quality information on how to stay healthy and fit longer. Caivano provides just the thing, combining her broad knowledge of dance and movement therapy training in this exceptional strength-training guide for men and women over 50 ... highly recommended.&quot; &amp;#8212; &lt;I&gt;Library Journal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&quot;Engaging and motivating book! Cris&#39; descriptions of how to do the exercises are reassuringly clear. Very user friendly! What truly sets this book apart however, is the way Cris addresses the whole person: body, mind, and spirit. Her smart, gentle, and balanced approach will get your energy flowing.&quot; &amp;#8212; Lee Holden, author, &lt;I&gt;7 Minutes of Magic&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
