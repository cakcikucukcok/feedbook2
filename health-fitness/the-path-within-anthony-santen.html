  <title>The Path Within - Anthony Santen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Path Within&lt;/i&gt; is an invitation to observe and transform the only person who can access and influence your life and your future: you! Filled with sound philosophy and practical examples, this book is the culmination of many client sessions and years of exploring how the human mind learns and is able to relearn its foundation of reality. With deeper understanding of this process, we are able to heal ourselves and effectively collaborate with the world and the reality of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book provides a step-by-step program to transform the deep-rooted thought processes that limit our potential for happiness. It shows us how to find and create our own personal answers that lead to more rewarding interactions with life, overcoming the root causes that lead to depression, anxiety, and anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Path Within&lt;/i&gt; does not tell you how to live your life. Instead, it helps you to objectively observe and remaster your old programming, giving you the power to change your life for good. As you progress through the chapters and integrate the exercises into your life, you rebuild your relationship with the world as an authentic sovereign being.&lt;/p&gt;" />
