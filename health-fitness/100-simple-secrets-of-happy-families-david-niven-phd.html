  <title>100 Simple Secrets of Happy Families - David Niven, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Simple Science of a Happy Family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From raising children to getting along with in-laws, what do people with close and loving families do differently than those with strained or unfulfilling relationships? Sociologists, therapists, and psychiatrists have spent entire careers investigating the ins and outs of family dynamics, yet their findings are inaccessible to ordinary people, hidden in obscure journals to be shared with other experts. Now, David Niven, the international bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The 100 Simple Secret&lt;/em&gt; series has collected the most current and significant data from more than a thousand of the best scientific studies on families and then spelled out the findings in plain English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice is based not on one person&#39;s unique experiences or opinions, but offers for the first time the research of noted scientists studying average American families. These findings have been boiled down to one hundred essential ways to find and maintain love, joy, and satisfaction in all family relationships. Each statistic is accompanied by a true story about a real family showing the results in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t Forget the Past: Parents who share stories of family history with their children create higher levels of concern for family members and increase the likelihood of their children&#39;s happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Price Tag: Once basic necessities are met, the increasing economic status of one&#39;s family has zero effect on the likelihood of feeling satisfied with life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let Every Opinion Be Heard: Senior citizens having trouble living in their own homes are 84 percent more likely to be satisfied with their housing situation if they feel as if their concerns are an important part of selecting a new home or facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Gift: Life satisfaction is 72 percent more likely among those who feel content with their family life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
