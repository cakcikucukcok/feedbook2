  <title>Ask Wisely, Listen Wisely - Enda Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Choosing death over what he considers a living hell, Sean attempts to end his desperate life. Incompletely done, so far, we meet him waking, disoriented and confused, in what turns out to be his own inner world somewhere between life and deathand his time is steadily bleeding out. 
Sean finds himself being escorted by allies to a mysterious meeting. There, he would have a rare opportunity to ask some fundamental questions about the nature of reality that could help him decide whether to return to his life or finally let go. 
What could he possibly ask that would entice him to try again? It is he who must choose. It is he who must understand the response.
Sean is in a race against enemies who are trying to hunt him down to destroy him, and time, as his opportunity and gateway back are progressively being engulfed by the fogs of death. Soon, there may be no choice
