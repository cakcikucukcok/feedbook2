  <title>Woman of Color - LaTonya Yvette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;LaTonya Yvette, the blogger and stylist behind the eponymous site, is unapologetically candid about life&#39;s trials, including motherhood, love, death, and racism. Her first book, &lt;I&gt;Woman of &lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;Color&lt;/I&gt;, is part memoir, part lifestyle guide--packed with moving essays, gorgeous original and archival photographs, and practical style and beauty advice. At the very heart, though, it&#39;s about LaTonya&#39;s experience growing up as a woman of color in Brooklyn.&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; Each beautifully designed chapter covers a different topic--the meaning behind her name, how vitiligo has shaped her definition of beauty, her childhood hairstyles, raising her children as a 20-something mom--and ends with thoughtful advice and lifestyle takeaways like how to tie a headwrap or incorporate new, bold colors into your wardrobe. &lt;I&gt;Woman of Color &lt;/I&gt;is real life, real style for women from all walks of life. In it, LaTonya has written a love letter to women, filling this book with vulnerable, imperfect truths from a black woman blogger, a voice not often seen on bookstore shelves.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
