  <title>America: a Country of Great Expectations - Sachin Anand Balram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="America is often called the land of opportunity, and for centuries the United States has lived up to that
motto. People from all over the world come to these shores seeking a better way of life for themselves
and their families. But often, adjusting to this new life is not easy. In &lt;i&gt;America: A Country of
Great Expectations&lt;/i&gt;, author Sachin Anand Balram provides a wealth of practical advice for those who immigrate to the United States.&lt;p&gt;
Balram, who came to the United States from Fiji more than thirty years ago, uses his personal experiences to teach others who face the same hurdles and challenges. He explores issues related to citizenship, health care, education, and
purchasing goods and services. He provides advice for finding a job, buying a car, and renting an apartment. He explains the functions of government agencies, the legal system, ideologies, and traditions and customs.&lt;p&gt;
This self-help guide provides a big-picture look at what an immigrant can expect when coming to the
United States. Balram shares his personal opinion, impressions, and perspective about his life in America, helping others to experience the American Dream of becoming prosperous and successful." />
