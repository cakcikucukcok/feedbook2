She smiled again,
still dressed in her polka dot panties
and holding her pink teddy bear.
Daddy in her heart
blood on her hands, behind her back
as they escort her to Dr. R
Whats your name, he asked, politely.
She smiled back and whispered, Daddys Little Girl.
Daddys little Girl  Poetic Chameleon (I Have Spoken)
Offering my womanly bliss
he welcomes it with a passionate kiss,
and gulps my love before I can fl inch.
Im lost in ecstasy as his fi ngers pinch.
My thighs feel paralyzed as I drift
into a wonderland of erotica and a fantasy of love
as he lifts
his head and releases a sweet smile.
My heart pounds fast as it runs miles.
Sexual Encore - Poetic Chameleon (Birth of a Spoken Language)
You live an evolution of survival.
It is through your tears
that hope was borna
plan to free a million fallen soldiers,
mourning mothers,
heartbroken and alone
but your hand lifted their heads
and the light of your touch bled revelations of liberation,
and freedom of their captured minds.
