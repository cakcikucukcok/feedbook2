  <title>How to Tame a Dawg - Pearl Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Sistah Girlfriends,
&lt;p&gt;How To Tame A Dawg:  The Pussy Kat Aint Doin It! is a real deal relationship book just for you.
&lt;p&gt;Ive read it!  You gotta get it!  
&lt;p&gt;This manual is Rated R for RAW because the language and sexual content is for women over the age of 18 (but it can be broken down for the younger sistahs).  
&lt;p&gt;Author, Pearl Jr. utilizes the street language of the hip-hop generation to make her points.  For example, are you the only one in the relationship?  Does putting him on blast get you what you want?  Is he proud to be a dawg and givin out resumes? 
&lt;p&gt;The book addresses all these questions plus many more that you thought you would never get answered.  Some dawgs you better be aware of, so that you can beware of the bull dawgs.   
&lt;p&gt;A few chapter titles include, What kind of dawg is he?  What kind of Pussy are you? Target practice, and If you dont want a dawg, then dont raise one!!
&lt;p&gt;Through her experiences, Pearl Jr. shares with us her proven strategies, techniques and subtle approaches to making the man in your life much easier to deal with.  
&lt;p&gt;Every women who reads this guide will find themselves in here somewhere; no matter their economic status, education or family background.  Youll be revitalized and motivated just as I was.  As a matter of fact, this will be your reference guide to a healthier relationship. 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you sistah girl Pearl.
&lt;p&gt;With love and respect,
