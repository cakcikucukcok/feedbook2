  <title>The Enthusiasm–Laffter Connection - Bob Moss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For decades, author Bob Hubba Jubba Moss has had a passion for teaching, promoting, and mentoring enthusiasm as a valuable life skill. In &lt;I&gt;The EnthusiasmLaffter Connection&lt;/I&gt;, he offers a thorough understanding of the enthusiasm-laffter connection, a concept based on the idea that hearty laffter is the greatest gesture of human enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on experiences gained during a long education career, the topics and ideas evolved from teaching biology, coaching sport teams, designing tennis visualization drills, and promoting hearty laffter as the best enthusiasm. The EnthusiasmLaffter Connection also explores easy-to-use and fun activities for putting more laffter and enthusiasm into daily life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moss provides an in-depth look at how to understand, develop, and sustain the lasting talent of eternal enthusiasm and positive energy. He communicates how enthusiasm becomes a learned life skill once one is aware of how important it is, how to get it, and how to maintain it on a 24/7 basis.&lt;/p&gt;" />
