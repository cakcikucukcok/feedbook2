  <title>How I Survived Breast Cancer: - Wayne Dornan PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every three minutes, a woman in the United States is diagnosed with breast cancer. Although more and more men and women are surviving breast cancer,
it is still a very frightening diagnosis, and your life is absolutely turned upside down when you are told you have breast cancer. 
This is a book of hope and inspiration. I wrote it for both men and women, and I believe that thousands of women and men will be helped by all the information in this book.
As you will see, throughout the book, each inspirational chapter, which is a documentation of my specific journey with breast cancer, is followed by a factual account 
that contains up-to-date information regarding breast cancer and treatment in both men and women.  
In addition to it&#39;s inspirational chapters, I hope that the factual information in his book will help both men and women make informed decisions  regarding their
treatment options and help them understand that there is quality of life after being diagnosed with breast cancer.
In this book you will read that almost from the beginning I decided that I would embrace my diagnosis and not be intimated by it. 
As you will read, I would take this diagnosis head-on; I wanted to feel empowered and not helpless! 
I want both men and women who read this book to understand that although its not easy, you have to maintain a positive attitude about your diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis and fight it every day. You can never give up. 
Lastly, although our lives will never be the same, as you will read in this book, there are tons of breast cancer survivors out there. 
So my advice is to live your life to the fullest and become an inspiration to other breast cancer survivors." />
