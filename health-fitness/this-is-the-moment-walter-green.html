  <title>This Is the Moment! - Walter Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This transformative work is about to take you on one man&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary journey of gratitude. Over the course of a year, &lt;strong&gt;Walter Green &lt;/strong&gt;traveled throughout the United States (and even abroad) to visit 44 of the people who have significantly impacted his life at various stages&amp;mdash;be it as a young man trying to find his way in the world, a businessman building his career and family, or a man who sold his company and found new meaning in mentoring and philanthropy. During these visits, Walter conveyed his profound gratitude in a purposeful and explicit way. He wanted to tell these men and women how much they mattered to him before anyone&amp;rsquo;s health or life was compromised and the opportunity was missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this inspirational gem of a book, not only will you accompany Walter on his gratitude journey, but you&amp;rsquo;ll also find yourself greatly moved by all that resulted from these powerful encounters. And as you read, you&amp;rsquo;ll acquire the tools to create meaningful conversations with your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;road-changers,&amp;rdquo; no matter what your age or life circumstance. These individuals could be family members, friends, teachers, colleagues, counselors, or any number of others who have influenced you. Your expressions of appreciation will undoubtedly enrich your relationships with them . . . and will provide you with amazing insights into your own life as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Walter says, &amp;ldquo;For you and for those whom you love and honor, I am hopeful that &lt;em&gt;This Is the Moment!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
