  <title>Pull up a Chair, Let&#39;s Talk - Mary Dorian Marshall</title>

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Pull Up a Chair, Lets TalkIs about life itself. I write about things from a womans point of view. I also write about things that I have seen, been through, and felt, at the time of puttingmy poems in power, print, and voice. An idea would come to me and I wouldimmediately jot it down without putting the idea off or waiting too long. There is nothing make believe, made up, or imaginary about my work. I like to keep real as it happens. Life isnt easy so thats why I write about it .The things that I say could uplift any person or put a smile on their face that theyve been putting off through depression. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Pull Up a Chair, Lets Talk was a joy for me to write and I hope one of my poems would bring joy to someones life. What inspired me to write was my Father for always being there for me, a Lady named Debra Kay for her encouraging words to me that are priceless, and my Favorite actress MoNique who one day I would love to meet. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Without further ado first &amp; foremost I Thank God! All day, everyday for giving the hidden talent I &lt;U&gt;did not&lt;/U&gt; know I had until I started to have problems myself. My favorite subject is English.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;P.S. I did say MoNique the actress. I hope that I had said enough, no too much or not too little.&lt;/P&gt;
