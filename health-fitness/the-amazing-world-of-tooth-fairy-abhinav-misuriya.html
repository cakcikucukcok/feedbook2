  <title>The Amazing World of Tooth Fairy - Abhinav Misuriya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a magical land far across the sky in the middle of Magicville lived a little tooth fairy with her fairy princess family and other creatures of wonder. She was called Emma.
She was the most gorgeous creature with her beautiful wings that had a tint of pink and purple and deer eyes that sparkle. What a beautiful little thing she was! Every small thing made her happy. She loved to wake up at night and fly across the sky with her family to collect tiny incisors, laterals, canines and molars of children. She loved to watch the little children and always wished she could play with them. Emma loved the children a little more than a normal fairy would. It was forbidden for tooth fairies to make contact with the children, but Emma always wanted to." />
