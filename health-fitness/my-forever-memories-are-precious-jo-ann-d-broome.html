  <title>My Forever Memories, Are Precious - Jo Ann D. Broome</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jo Ann D. Broome was born in Columbia, South Carolina, the youngest of three children and the baby girl.  Her special memories of early childhood were interrupted when her dad was drafted into World War II at the age of thirty-nine.  She, her mother, and two older brothers survived some lean years during her dads absence from the family as well as and his newly formed business venture.
	These few years of change at the age of five had a lifelong effect on her growing up years.  The memories that lingered were both happy and sad, good and bad, and several tragic ones that never leave her mind.
	This book was written as a means of expressing her gratitude to family and friends for their part they played in making such precious memories in her life.  They are written for future generations of family who will know their grandparents or great-grandparents personalities through these stories. In each situation you can see the various characters and feel the emotions that make them both real and significant to each precious memory related by the writer." />
