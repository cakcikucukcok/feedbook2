  <title>A Dark Relationship Secret to Make a Guy Commit and Propose Fast and Easily. - Jeff Mike</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
Do you wish you could make a guy commit to you and stop wasting your time? Do you feel your inner clock ticking and feel the need to get married and have children? Why is your guy content to stay on the fence about your relationship and seemingly never want to settle down? There are some issues that you need to consider when trying to make a guy commit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it just selfishness?The first issue that is important to explore is his willingness to meet your needs. If he knows how you feel about settling down and starting a family, why is he not willing to compromise with you? For example, if you would like to get engaged right away, why can he not at least agree to get engaged and wait a year before marriage. There are always compromises available to people who are not selfish. You need to do some investigation into his motivation for being your boyfriend? Figure out if he does take your feelings and desires into consideration or if he&amp;#39;s only looking out for himself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it just fear?When a guy has dealt with the messy divorce of his own parents, he will understandably be afraid to consider this type of commitment. Of course, he will not want to have to go through that kind of pain again. You can&amp;#39;t make a guy commit to you if he hasn&amp;#39;t ever dealt with this childhood trauma.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this situation, it can be beneficial to work through those issues together and explain to him, both in words and in actions, that you and he are very different from his parents. You can discuss these issues together and make plans together to do engagement and marriage differently. There are many small groups, classes, and books available on how to have a healthy relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it just laziness?Some guys are so busy with work, school, or other activities that they don&amp;#39;t have any time or energy left to deal with personal issues. This can include your relationship. If you&amp;#39;re sure that it is just temporary situation, you might want to wait until he is through with his tough season before broaching the subject.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you feel that you just cannot wait anymore, then let him know that you don&amp;#39;t need or expect a lot from him. He may feel pressure to have enough money to buy you an expensive ring or propose in some creative and clever way. You can hint to him that these things really don&amp;#39;t matter to you and the main thing you care about is your love for each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, if this is what you tell him, don&amp;#39;t ever bring up in the future about your disappointment with how he proposed or the size of your ring. You can&amp;#39;t tell him that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter and then throw it back in his face later on. That&amp;#39;s just immature and unfair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Think about and consider these issues and then you will be able to make a guy commit to you.&lt;br /&gt;
