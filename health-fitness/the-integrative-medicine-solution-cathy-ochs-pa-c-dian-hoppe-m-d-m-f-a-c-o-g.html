  <title>The Integrative Medicine Solution - Cathy Ochs Pa-C, Dian Hoppe M.D.M F.A.C.O.G</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Get out of the health-care trap.
Transition into an integrative medicine practice.
Return to practicing medicine the way you always dreamt it could be.
The United States spends the most health-care dollars per person in the world. Yet we are a sick, fat, and tired nation. Both patients and health-care providers are dissatisfied with our health-care system.
We have a diseased management system masquerading as a health-care system.
This system is broken!
Integrative medicine is a solution to heal our broken system. The Integrative Medicine Solution is a practical guidebook for physician assistants, supervising physicians, nurse practitioners, and other health-care providers who want to transition from treating symptoms to the root causes.
	Patients are healthier, happier, and less dependent on drugs.
	Providers are rewarded for spending more time with their patients.
	It will restore balance and joy in your practice and life.
This book is a great introduction and practical guide for PAs or any other health-care providers who are wanting to start their own integrative practice.
Jana Pratt, PA-C, Womens Integrative Health Specialist
This is an awesome read and a great education piece for all health care providers to read. I think it is a must read.
Nathan S. Bryant, PhD, author of The Nitric Oxide (NO) Solution
Excellent job . . . your book will shed light on what patients need to know.
