  <title>In the Making - Tianamonet Tobie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is designed to help adults, but mainly the youth in surviving while learning from the everyday trails &amp; tribulations. Nothing is too hard to perform; any and everything can be achieved with FAITH and prayer to the Awesome LORD above! If everyone remember that GOD will NEVER put too much on us that we cant handle; everything will always be alright. As long as each individual can stand proud and believe in themselves; they should overcome all fears and become successful. Nothing in life is just giving to us without a little FAITH, help, guidance, money, love, patience and tolerance! LIFE IS ALL ABOUOT LIVING IT UP, TAKEN CHANCES, LEARNING FROM MANY MISTAKES AND EXPERIENCES AND LAUGHING WHILE LIVING. IN THE END; WE ALL ONLY HAVE ONE LIFE TO LIVE!
I want to first off thank God for all he does and will continue to do for me and my family. I want to secondly thank my mother for all of her unconditional love, support, guidance and help. I want to thirdly thank my son and daughter for helping me stay focus and be the best mother I know how to be; for it is their love, beauty and health that keep me alive and happy! I Also want to thank my five brothers for always having my back, giving me positive lectures and unconditional love. Lastly I want to thank all my friends, fans and everyone else who appreciate me and my doings and also support me. I have revised the ending to this book three times because life can be mysterious and unexpectedly surprising. Im only able to write this book and give such G.A.M.E. and knowledge to the readers in the world because I have courage and past experience mixed with present experience. I hope this book can bring LIFE &amp; JOY to everyone who read this book. It has a lot of teachings inside each chapter and can help anyone learn and be more open-minded to productive things and success! May you read this book with an open mind and stay focus. Also remember to stay open-minded and read my other book: inner impression/outer expression. Thank you and May God Bless you and your family!" />
