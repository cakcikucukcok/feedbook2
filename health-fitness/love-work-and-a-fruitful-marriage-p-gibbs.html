  <title>Love, Work, and a Fruitful Marriage - P. Gibbs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Building a strong, healthy, and loving relationship in todays world can be challenging. The good news is that it is not impossible. In her inspirational guidebook, author P. Gibbs shares a step-by-step process that helps both men and women build stronger selves with a foundation in Christ that, in turn, can lead to stronger relationships and marriages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gibbs relies on her personal and spiritual experiences as well as Gods Word to outline a journey of self discovery. Through her Christian-based road map, Gibbs encourages men and women to shun negative thoughts and behaviors, establish and follow values, and forgive past hurts in their own lives before building a fruitful relationship or marriage. She traces her process to achieving healthy, spiritual relationships and shares accompanying anecdotes, scriptures, and thought-provoking questions. She provides practical tips and insight for those seeking a partner who will not only love them wholly, but also make them a better person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, Work, and a Fruitful Marriage &lt;/em&gt;offers inspirational advice on how to build strong frameworks within ourselves and our relationships through faith, perseverance, and Gods grace and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
