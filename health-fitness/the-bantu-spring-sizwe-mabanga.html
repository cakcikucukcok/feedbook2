  <title>The Bantu Spring - Sizwe Mabanga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE BANTU SPRING
Hello my fellow Bantu. I wrote a book for you.
It&#39;s about your rebirth.
My father taught me that if you must be anything, be everything. But to be everything, I must start somewhere. I must start by understanding where I am. We all must.
So. To begin your journey to being everything that you can be, to begin your rebirth, I suggest you start by reading this book.
It will help you to identify why it&#39;s been so difficult to grow and live your own life until now. It&#39;ll give you new ways of seeing the problem and hopefully kick off a new coversation about what we Bantu are actually about. 
Who knows. Maybe you&#39;ll be the architect of tomorrow? Maybe you&#39;ll win the all-time everything? Lol.
I can&#39;t promise that you&#39;ll like this book. Most people won&#39;t like this book. 
But just because you don&#39;t like it, it doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t need it. Most people need this book. The contents cure all forms of illnesses including cowardice, bigotry, pettiness and delusion.
Seriously though.
&quot;The book that blacks need.&quot;
