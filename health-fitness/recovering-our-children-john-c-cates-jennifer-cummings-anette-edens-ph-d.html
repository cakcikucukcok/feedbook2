  <title>Recovering Our Children - John C. Cates, Jennifer Cummings, Anette Edens Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Art Greer&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;I&gt;Assistant to the General Presbyter, The Presbytery of New Covenant Presbyterian Church (U.S. A.)&lt;/I&gt;
When parents came to me, having discovered their child was involved in drugs, and asked, &quot;What in the word do I do now?&quot;, my answer was simple: &quot;See John Cates!&quot; It still is. Barring that, this book, &lt;I&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recovering Our Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/I&gt;, is the next best thing!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil Lineberger&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;I&gt;Pastor of William Trace Baptist Church of Houston, Texas and Past President of the Baptist General Convention of Texas&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;I&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recovering Our Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is a winner. John Cates and Jennifer Cummings draw upon their education and experience to help parents recognize the evidence of a young person&#39;s abuse of chemicals, to help the parents and young person reach out to those who can help, and to help the parents and young person reclaim control of their own lives. This book will serve as a valuable and encouraging tool for those who have reached the end of their rope. I highly recommend &lt;b&gt;&lt;I&gt;Recovering Our Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patricia Creer&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;I&gt;Past President of the Texas Association of Addiction Professionals&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;I&gt;Recovering Our Children&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, derived from experience with thousands of children and their families is reflective of the hard earned lessons of professionals who have intervened in a personal way for a number of years. I hope that this book will reach many in need, for it will help them. But I also hope that those who compose the community that will nurture Alternative Peer Groups will read it and pay attention." />
