  <title>The Art and Science of Being Still - Douglas D Zaccanelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why should you read this book? Being Still is not another psychological theory or way to cope with depression. Quite the opposite, as a mental health and healing method it runs counter to the psychologies and therapies now being used in treating stress and depression. Whether you are just down and in a stressed out place in your life or you are dealing with deep and chronic depression, this book has been written for you.
In this book there is healing information that you may never have considered. For instance, it explains why you will never think, talk, therapy, medicate or meditate away depression. It will demonstrate the mental dynamics that prove that the more you think and talk about those intrusive thoughts the worse they will get. It explains how and why thinking and talking about them only magnifies the problems. The things taught here will help you to understand what is really going on in your head. You will also learn how and why simply stilling your thoughts is the way to overcome stress and depression.
The reason for the success in healing for so many of those that practice this method can be summed up by quoting a Vietnam Veteran that had been dealing with depression and PTSD for over 40 years. After attending Mr. Zaccanellis class at a VA facility and practicing Being Still for a few weeks he was heard to say, I cant believe it was that simple." />
