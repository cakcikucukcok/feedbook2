      <meta name="description" content="The book that carers have been waiting for...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are currently an estimated 50 million people worldwide living with dementia. It is anticipated by Alzheimer&#39;s Disease International that this number will almost double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.50 million in 2050.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;International author Carolyn Cranwell has 18 years experience as a self-taught Alzheimer&#39;s carer.
