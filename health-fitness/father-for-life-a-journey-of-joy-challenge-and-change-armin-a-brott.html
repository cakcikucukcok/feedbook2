  <title>Father for Life: A Journey of Joy, Challenge, and Change - Armin A. Brott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The essential guide for every dad by the bestselling author of Expectant Father and the New Father series, Father for Life is the first book to look at the phases of fatherhood from the conception of a child through the grandfather years. While there have been many books about child development and motherhood, precious little has been written about how fathers change and develop as parents or about how children influence their fathers&#39; development. Yet most fathers know that a man who&#39;s just found out that his wife is expecting is a very different kind of man from the one he&#39;ll be when he holds his newborn in his arms for the first time. And that same dad will have changed again--psychologically and emotionally--by the time his baby speaks for the first time. Fathers evolve and develop throughout every stage of their children&#39;s lives--from the preschool and elementary school years through the tumultuous teens, young adulthood, middle age, grandfather years, and beyond. But no matter what the child&#39;s age, a father is always a father." />
