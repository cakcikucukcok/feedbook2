  <title>Fit at Mid-Life - Samantha Brennan, Tracy Isaacs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A uniquely feminist approach to how women can break free from what society thinks and get active in their forties, fifties, and beyond. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;What if you could be fitter now than you were in your twenties? And what if you could achieve it while feeling more comfortable and confident in your body than ever before? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;In this empowering, accessible book, bloggers and professors Samantha Brennan and Tracy Isaacs offer a new approach to fitness—one that champions strength, health, and personal accomplishment over weight loss and aesthetics. They share their own experiences of getting active later in life and explore the many challenges, questions, and issues women face when seeking fitness in their forties, fifties, and beyond. Drawing from the latest research and their popular blog &lt;em&gt;Fit Is a Feminist Issue&lt;/em&gt;, they deliver a wealth of concrete advice on everything from how to keep bones strong to what types of fitness activities give the biggest returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;Taking a feminist perspective, the authors also challenge society’s default whats, whys, and hows of every aspect of getting fit to show how women can best take charge of their health—no matter what their shape, size, age, or ability. &lt;/p&gt;" />
