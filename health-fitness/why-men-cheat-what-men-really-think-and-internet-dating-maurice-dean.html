  <title>Why Men Cheat, What Men Really Think and Internet Dating - Maurice Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why Men Cheat is intended to give its readers a realistic look into dating and relationships from an observation standpoint distinct from any book of its kind. Unlike doing research where an author may interview several single people or a few couples with a questionnaire to get their perspective on dating, longevity, and infidelity. Why Men Cheat is based on unscripted access and full disclosure based on the normal day-to-day interaction with would-be friends, family, and coworkers.&lt;p&gt; 
 My observation has been the type of fly-on-the-wall access that we often, after the fact, wish we could have had to better make an assessment of a certain situation. Rather than interviewing a couple or setting up a night to go out on the town to research the behavior of the person being interviewed as most people do in their research, I have had undetected interaction and surveillance of the behavior and true intentions of friends and strangers because I too was part of the dating environment.&lt;p&gt;
I have maintained and outside looking in perspective on many relationships and marriages throughout the years. I have witnessed firsthand the start of romance for many relationships but unfortunately been around to see several of those bonds deteriorate over time because of neglect or infidelity.&lt;p&gt;
My advice, although sometimes not favorable to what women really want to hear as they confide in me, is unbiased and based on what men really think. &lt;p&gt;" />
