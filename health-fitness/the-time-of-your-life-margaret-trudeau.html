  <title>The Time of Your Life - Margaret Trudeau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this candid and engaging book, Margaret Trudeau, author of the #1 bestselling memoir &lt;em&gt;Changing My Mind&lt;/em&gt;, offers women an inspirational and practical approach to creating a healthy, happy, secure and satisfying future life. From dating and online romance to health practices and financial planning, &lt;em&gt;The Time of Your Life&lt;/em&gt; explores the fundamentals needed for the best future by discussing cornerstone issues such as housing, money, sex, friendship and children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always a rebel at heart, Margaret looks at what the experts have to say and weaves through her own point of view, culling insightful and funny anecdotes from her early marriage to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau when she was a twenty-two-year-old hippie from the west coast of Canada, to her life as a single mom raising three young boys in the often hostile glare of the media spotlight. Margaret&#39;s mental health challenges, her decision to leave her second marriage, the devastating loss of her son Michel and first husband Pierre, and her re-invention as a coveted spokesperson and fundraiser make her uniquely qualified to offer her own perspective on the choices women face in their fifties and beyond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Practical, straightforward and filled with tips and ideas for living a rich life, &lt;em&gt;The Time of Your Life&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect book for women of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
