  <title>The Woman&#39;s Holistic Guide to Divorce: Simple, Practical, and Light-Hearted Tips for Navigating the Treacherous Waters of Going Your Separate Way - Wendi Schuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A result of the author&#39;s own experience finding her way through a particularly traumatizing divorce, this guide includes the usual self-help aspect as well as stories and advice that other women were willing to share with the author to help any woman sail through a turbulent time. Offering a fresh and uncommon perspective beyond the already long list of books on divorce that focus on getting through a break up&#39;s emotional toll or how to deal with children, the book&#39;s usefulness covers a comprehensive list of solutions to challenges that arise from attorneys offering legal and financial advice to saving on cosmetics and holiday gifts. There is a practical list of household hints as well as methods for helping kids get through such an upsetting period and ways to confront health issues that arise as a result of a stressful time. The author stresses the importance of such a life transition and how this guide can be a safety net providing a myriad of suggestions that help women move from a victim status to regaining their strength of inner peace and wisdom. Every woman who finds herself in the middle of a break up will find this the ideal all-inclusive companion for moving on. WENDI SCHULLER is a pseudonym for a published author who has conducted classes on various subjects. She draws upon her knowledge as a nurse, Neuro-Linguistic Programmer (NLP), and hypnotherapist, providing a blueprint to guide women through this difficult transition. Schuller hired an attorney for a court divorce, but decided to go the collaborative route instead and has worked with a mediator post-divorce. Her passion is international travel and she devised savvy cost-cutting measures to achieve this dream. Schuller worked in the public schools and observed firsthand the effects of divorce on children. Her aim is to have families experience a smoother divorce, keeping their sanity intact and obtaining the healthiest outcome possible." />
