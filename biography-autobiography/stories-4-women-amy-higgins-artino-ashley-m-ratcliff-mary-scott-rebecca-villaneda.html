  <title>Stories 4 Women - Amy Higgins Artino, Ashley M. Ratcliff, Mary Scott, Rebecca Villaneda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;Stories 4 Women&lt;/I&gt;, a collection of true short stories about the fairer sex, was created on an understanding that there is an unspoken solidarity that bonds us as women. However, we four writers felt it appropriate to give a voice to some of the stories unique to the womans experience, including the ones that seldom are discussed in the open. They range from the somber situations of being the victims of sexual assault and the death of a loved one, to the more whimsical reminiscences about our teenage crushes and childhood tendencies. Think back to how you felt when you started doing things for yourself or when that guy who you thought was the one broke your heart. Remember when you took that long walk down the aisle and into your new life, or when you discovered that first stray gray hair sprouting from your head? These short stories go to show that regardless of age, race, political and religious affiliations, and background, we can all relate to the issues of womanhood. Stories 4 Women also shares insights into what enduring these experiences has molded us into: We are thoughtful, seasoned, refreshed, independent, accomplished, nostalgic, forgiving and self-assured women. These are our stories. These are your stories. These are stories for women.&lt;/P&gt;" />
