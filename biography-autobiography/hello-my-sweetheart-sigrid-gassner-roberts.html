  <title>Hello, My Sweetheart - Sigrid Gassner- Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Sigrid Gassner-Roberts unique work evolves from her recollections of narrating her life story to her husband, who lies in a coma in a Viennese hospital after a brain aneurysm. The doctors tell her that he can hear her, so she begins by reminding him of their first date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sigrid had been a young Austrian student who originally came to America to study on a Fulbright scholarship. She had a busy teaching career and her work took her from the US to Austria to Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It was in Australia that she met her future husband, a US naval officer who proposed only a few short weeks after they met in 1975. The couple had been married but four years when her husband had his stroke. Sigrid finds a path to caring for him while carrying on with her teaching duties and their love story continues until his death. &lt;/p&gt;" />
