Over her more than six-decade-long career she met presidents, performed for the Queen of England, and partied with kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this fabulous personal tour, she recalls wonderful moments with the greats of the entertainment world&amp;#8212;Lucille Ball, Frank Sinatra, Bette Davis, Phyllis Diller, and many, many more&amp;#8212;sharing stories that shed new light on her life and career and the glittering world of Hollywood then and now.

Combining her wicked sense of humor and appealing charm, she reveals the personal side of show business and fame in funny, poignant, and delightful reminiscences. Nothing is off limits: Debbie talks about her sex life, her family drama&amp;#8212;and even shares a few secret recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A true Hollywood icon, beloved by millions of fans around the world, Debbie Reynolds died on December 28, 2016, at the age of 84, just one day after the death of her daughter, actress and author Carrie Fisher.&lt;/p&gt;" />
