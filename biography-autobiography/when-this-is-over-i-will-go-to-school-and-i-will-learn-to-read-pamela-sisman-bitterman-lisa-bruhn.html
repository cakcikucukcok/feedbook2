  <title>When This Is Over, I Will Go To School, And I Will Learn To Read - Pamela Sisman Bitterman, Lisa Bruhn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No one knows the story of Kenya better than the children who live it. I had the opportunity to travel to this country and become immersed with the families there. The result is a1500-word nonfiction picture book titled, &amp;quot;When This Is Over, I Will Go To School, And I Will Learn To Read&amp;quot;: A Story of Hope and Friendship for One Young Kenyan Orphan. This true story of one little boy is told in his own words. While there are many books about Africa on the market, none are told from a child&amp;#39;s point of view like this one.&lt;br&gt;The children from the village created the book&amp;#39;s illustrations. I asked these students to draw what represented family, love, happiness, sadness, fear and hope for them. I have powerful photographs of the children, the school, the village and the countryside, the hospital, the mobile clinic and orphan program. It is this truth that is certain to nudge the hearts and minds of parents, teachers and children everywhere." />
