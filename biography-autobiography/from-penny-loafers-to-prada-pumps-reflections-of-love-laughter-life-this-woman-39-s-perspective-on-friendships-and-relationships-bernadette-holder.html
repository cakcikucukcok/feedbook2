      <meta name="description" content="I have come to realize, life is full of lessons learned. While we are all very different, we are in most ways the same. All of our experiences help us to grow and  to shape our lives. We all have stories, and we each share a common thread of experiencing that not-so-great relationship; whether it be a friendship gone bad or the one or two relationships you&#39;d rather not remember because you are still stunned by your lapse in judgement. Well, you can rest asure you were not the first and you most certainly will not be the last to share those sentiments. Our journey is merely a map of accounts that we can pass along to someone else to help them take that same path, create a similar path or make a u-turn to avoid a possible road block ahead altogether. There are several roads that may lead to your destination, I belive the thing to remember is to take the scenic route, enjoy your jouney while you&#39;re traveling. Life is too short not to." />
