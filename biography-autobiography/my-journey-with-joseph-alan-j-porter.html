  <title>My Journey With Joseph - Alan J Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story, which defies all logic, of a pre-destined journey to North America of over 16,000 miles that I, with a friend, had undertaken with an agenda utterly beyond our control. It depicts the power of fate, destiny, spiritual awakening, and travel to the homeland of Joseph and Ollokot of the Nez Perce Native American tribe, the consequences of which are still unfolding. Joseph had pre-ordained the path for this journey some two years before, when I received various visions to paint of places in North America of which I had no prior knowledge, nor had any images to work upon. Our journey ultimately took us to these places, several of which were not on our planned itinerary." />
