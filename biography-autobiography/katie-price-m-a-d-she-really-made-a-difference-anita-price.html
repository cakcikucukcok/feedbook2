  <title>Katie Price M.A.D She Really Made A Difference - Anita Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is much more than the story of baby Katie&#39;s arrival. She was stillborn and she put in an appearance on 13th September 1993. The gestation period for the book has taken a long time because it is not just a catalogue of the events before and after her delivery at the hospital. She was STILL BORN and she affected so many people in so many positive ways. Her arrival and premature departure made me take stock of my life. At times, while typing, I found myself laughing and crying at the same time. I hope and wish for Katie to make a difference in your life too. One little bundle; so tiny, so peaceful and oh, so powerful. Prepare for your own awakening. &quot;The Lullaby Trust wishes Anita all the best with her new book. We are so pleased that she found our support services helpful at such a difficult time in her life&quot; FSID was renamed the lullaby Trust in 2013 . The Lullaby Trust provides expert advice on safer sleep for babies supports bereaved families and raises awareness on sudden infant death. Action Medical Research is a UK-wide charity saving and changing children&#39;s lives through medical research. We want to make a difference in: • tackling premature birth and treating sick and vulnerable babies • helping children affected by disability, disabling conditions and infections • targeting rare diseases that together severely affect many forgotten children. Anita was interviewed by AMR, shared her experience to help others. Just one breakthrough, however small, can mean the world www.action.org.uk" />
