      <meta name="description" content="I am a single mum, and I have four children, but one of them  doesnt living with me at the moment. I live in a small village in the East Riding,. I have always enjoyed writing  short stories since I was a child, and  always had a dream, that one day I would  try write my own book.
    I enjoy doing a lot of different sport such as running, swimming and aerobics in my spare time as well spending time with my children. I also do craft fairs, and donate funds to  different charities   within my community. I am a caring person and I always think of other people before myself. I have had a pretty stressful life,but now I am turning my life around and being positive for a change. I have wrote this book because I hope it will help other people who are in the same position as me, and my family are. And it doesnt matter how down or upset you are somehow you can find the strength  from somewhere to plod on and hopefully fight to the end." />
