  <title>Land of Second Chances: The Impossible Rise of Rwanda&#39;s Cycling Team - Tim Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hailed as &quot;the sports book of the year,&quot; &lt;i&gt;Land of Second Chances&lt;/i&gt; is the inspiring true story of four men who found a new hope for Rwanda. Meet Adrien Niyonshuti, Tom Ritchey, Jonathan Boyer, and Paul Kagame.&lt;/b&gt; In a land clamoring for heroes, they confront impossible odds as they struggle to put an upstart cycling team on the map--and find redemption in the eyes of the world. &lt;i&gt;Land of Second Chances&lt;/i&gt; is an inspirational story of hope and victory for Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Rwanda is a tiny, landlocked country dropped like a pebble on the equator, it is a lush and beautiful land fertile with hope and searching for a new identity. So when its best young bike racer, Adrien Niyonshuti, becomes obsessed with earning a slot to compete in the London Olympic Games, all eyes turn to him. Supporting Adrien is his coach, Jonathan Boyer, the first American to race in the Tour de France. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also present: Tom Ritchey, an inventor of the mountain bike who comes to Rwanda with money and a vision to help coffee farmers raise their standard of living with a new breed of bike. And there is Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, a man piecing together an egalitarian future for his country but who is all too susceptible to the corruption of power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Land of Second Chances&lt;/i&gt; is the incredible true story of struggle, hope, and the life-giving promise of redemption through the unifying power of sport.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Land of Second Chances&lt;/i&gt; is a tale that quite brilliantly portrays the power of sport to effect change.
