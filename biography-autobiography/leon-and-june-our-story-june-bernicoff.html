  <title>Leon and June: Our Story - June Bernicoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As founding cast members of hit TV show Gogglebox, Leon and June won the hearts of a nation with their warm humour and their obvious unending love for each other. When Leon sadly died at Christmas 2017, Gogglebox viewers were bereft with calls for a state funeral for the national treasure.
Together for 60 years, coming to terms with life without Leon has been a difficult process for June but she has many treasured memories of their marriage that will never leave her. Here in this touching memoir, she looks back at their life together. From when, aged 18, she first laid eyes on Leon at teacher training college in 1955; their fight to marry when their parents disapproved; happy memories of 1960s Liverpool; to building a loving home and family together, before finding fame as pensioners. Firm favourites of the Gogglebox show, they were loved for their gentle teasing, Leon&#39;s cheeky gags and humorous rants and June&#39;s unerring patience and caring touch.
Along the way they&#39;ve experienced their fair share of highs and lows but as Leon always said: &#39;As long as June&#39;s here, I&#39;m all right.&#39; They did it all together. Now June shares with us the secret to a truly happy marriage in this wonderful celebration of two lives well lived." />
