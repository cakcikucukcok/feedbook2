  <title>My Adventures with Your Money - T.D. Thornton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today, we talk about Bernard Madoff, but in the early 20th century, they talked about George Graham Rice.  Born Jacob Simon Herzig in 1870, he later changed his name - just as he would frequently change his swindles to make himself into one of the most colorfully successful villains in American history. T.D. Thornton now tells the story of Rice&#39;s life as it unfolded against the dark rise of American greed in the early 20th century. In the early 1900s, Rice made market-manipulation killings valued at billions in today&#39;s dollars by inventing fictitious boom towns in Death Valley and flagrantly exaggerating worthless mining claims throughout the West. As a shameless racetrack tipster, Rice cultivated a national following of 100,000 daily subscribers who paid for the privilege of being tipped to bet on hopeless nags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vilified by securities regulators as the &quot;Jackal of Wall Street,&quot; Rice sparked riots in Manhattan&#39;s financial district by perfecting the art of &quot;bucket shop&quot; trading with the sole purpose of bilking the public blind. He was capable of pulling off everything from street corner rip-offs for pocket change to elaborately scripted gambling hoaxes, all while being vilified by old-guard profiteers like J.P. Morgan and befriended by gangsters like Arnold Rothstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Adventures With Your Money&lt;/i&gt;, T.D. Thornton has given us a real-life version of  &lt;i&gt;The Sting&lt;/i&gt; with one of America&#39;s most colorful con men at it&#39;s center.&lt;/p&gt;" />
