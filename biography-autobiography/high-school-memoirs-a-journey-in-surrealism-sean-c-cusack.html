  <title>High School Memoirs: a Journey in Surrealism - Sean C. Cusack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Synopsis
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	High School Memoirs: A Journey in Surrealism is a tear-jerking, hilarious ride for a less-than-ordinary High School student who battles bullies and librarians to become King of the Classroom.  Set in a small Catholic High School on the north side of Chicago, author Sean Cusack takes us on a surrealistic journey through four fun-filled years of triumph and tragedy in this unique epic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	The journey begins with Sean Cusack entering St. Bernadin High School in August of 1995 as a very young and innocent Freshman student.  He focuses on several life changing experiences in his infant days of High School that change him forever.  Innocence Lost traces the steps Sean Cusack took that ultimately lead him on a path toward frequent battles with students and the school faculty and Administration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	As a Sophomore, The Ride most certainly takes us on a ride through fights, vandalism, and verbal debacles that continued to steer the vengeful ship that Sean Cusack had been building since a Freshman.  He now had become the ships Captain as it set sail.  The Ride takes us through many strange and mysterious encounters that add more of a surrealist element to this budding melodrama and comedic satire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Sean Cusacks roses bud Junior Year in Forever Remembered, when he becomes a charismatic hero and leader of a rebellious group of students that pillage and plunder the school and faculty in wild and zany antics.  Forever Remembered embodies the humorous and more imaginative side of Sean Cusack as the journey through High School becomes more surreal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Senior Year wraps up the trials and tribulations that Sean Cusack had endured thus far in his High School experience culminating into one person after years of battling the Defunct Administration.  He is molded by evil as the rebellious youth becomes totally hellbent on crippling the school.  In the end, he loses friends, respect from teachers, but most of all, he loses faith in his cause, yet ends his High School experience with a fantastical and triumphant bow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Sean Cusack proves that not all High School stories are the same in this turbulent and chaotic autobiography.  High School Memoirs: A Journey in Surrealism chronicles a strange and unique history that is truly a step above the rest." />
