      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ron Swindall looks back at a life spent teaching, coaching, playing music, and enjoying the great outdoors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ordinary guy from Indian Creek, near the little town of Pound, Virginia, he says there is no better place for him to call home. It was a small town, and he made lifelong friends there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of his life has been spent in or around Wise County, Virginia, either in Pound, Norton, Wise, or Powell Valley near Big Stone Gap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes been fortunate to enjoy a successful marriage, and he and his wife have three children. Together, they enjoy fishing, camping, and spending time outdoorsand he doesnt regret a single day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his memoir, he traces his family ancestry as well as the history of the area his family has called home. He also looks back at his thirty-seven year tenure as a teacher with the Wise County, Virginia, school system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes the case that we must all maintain and support the public education system, which will help us move toward a brighter future, and shares lessons learned over a well-spent life in &lt;i&gt;Chords and Stories.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
