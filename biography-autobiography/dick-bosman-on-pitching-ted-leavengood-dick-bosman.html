  <title>Dick Bosman on Pitching - Ted Leavengood, Dick Bosman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dick Bosman&amp;rsquo;s career in Major League Baseball as a player and coach has spanned more than 50 years. He pitched eleven seasons in the American League, was the Major League pitching coach for multiple teams, and has served as a minor league pitching coordinator for the Tampa Bay Rays since 2001. Throughout his years in baseball, Bosman has developed a distinct pitching philosophy and astute insights into the cat-and-mouse game between hitter and pitcher. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Dick Bosman on Pitching: Lessons from the Life of a Major League Ballplayer and Pitching Coach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, author Ted Leavengood examines Bosman&amp;rsquo;s life in baseball, from his winning the ERA title in the American League in 1969 and his no-hitter in 1974 to his current coaching position with the Tampa Bay Rays. For those wanting an inside look at the essentials of pitching, Leavengood includes insights and tips from Bosman throughout the book, compiled through hours of personal interviews. Bosman has worked for and with some of the best pitchers and coaches in major league baseball, and he not only shares stories from their time together but also the many things he learned from them about the game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dick Bosman has found enormous success working with young ballplayers at all levels and fostered innovations&amp;mdash;such as his signature slide step&amp;mdash;that have impacted pitching in today&amp;rsquo;s game. With personal anecdotes from Bosman, his teammates, and those he coached, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Dick Bosman on Pitching &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;will entertain and inform young pitchers as well as baseball fans of all generations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
