  <title>The Guardians: Kingman Brewster, His Circle, and the Rise of the Liberal Establishment - Geoffrey Kabaservice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How liberalism and one of the most dramatic eras in American history were shaped by an influential university president and his powerful circle of friends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yale&#39;s Kingman Brewster was the first and only university president to appear on the covers of &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Newsweek&lt;/i&gt;, and the last of the great campus leaders to become an esteemed national figure. He was also the center of the liberal establishment--a circle of influential men who fought to keep the United States true to ideals and extend the full range of American opportunities to all citizens of every class and color. Using Brewster as his focal point, Geoffrey Kabaservice shows how he and his lifelong friends--Kennedy adviser McGeorge Bundy, Attorney General and statesman Elliot Richardson, New York mayor John Lindsay, Bishop Paul Moore, and Cyrus Vance, pillar of Washington and Wall Street--helped usher this country through the turbulence of the 1960s, creating a legacy that still survives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a narrative that is as engaging and lively as it is meticulously researched, &lt;i&gt;The Guardians&lt;/i&gt; judiciously and convincingly reclaims the importance of Brewster and his generation, illuminating their vital place in American history as the bridge between the old establishment and modern liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
