  <title>Learning to Rejoice in the Middle of …! - Mary L. Kline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Learning to Rejoice in the Middle of !&lt;/I&gt; Brings to life the travels and missionary work of Phil and Mary Kline, husband and wife, who served together as missionaries of the Free Methodist Church in several African countries between 1953 and 1968. Mary, the author, wrote weekly letters home to her parents, chronicling their experiences and observations. Decades later, she turned that collection of saved correspondence into the foundation of &lt;I&gt;Learning to Rejoice in the Middle of !&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil supervised a variety of construction projects during the years he and Mary served in several countries, including South Africa, Burundi, and Rwanda. Marys letters bring to life the challenges they faced in their missionary work and illumine the many small details that come together to make up the lives of a missionary family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Learning to Rejoice in the Middle of !&lt;/I&gt; gives voice to a pair of committed and hardworking missionaries who labored together to use their talents to serve others, to live out their faith by their words and actions, to pass on that faith to others. Whether you have an interest in the history of Christian missionaries in Africa or you desire to immerse yourself in the story of people who follow their calling, &lt;I&gt;Learning to Rejoice in the Middle of !&lt;/I&gt; Will inspire and educate you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
