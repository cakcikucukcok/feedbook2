      <meta name="description" content="Truth, we all want this. Here are 6 short stories of true events that I encountered in my journey of life. Each one of different character and places all of whom are complete strangers that I met. We never know who we will meet, who will change our lives, or there life. In this world today where it takes time to listen to the very nature of humans, an art that seems to be slipping away. I hope to capture the reader in these memoirs of this journey we all walk. Life would be meaningless if there were no one to share this with. As I capture myself in the moment again, writing and reminiscing of the people  I have met, I am touched by the sublimity of human nature and love. Love is powerful. Love can change people. Love can change the world. Engage in this great read that I hope you ask yourself as I ask the reader, are you listening?" />
