  <title>False Memories: Adventures of the Living Dali - Gabrielle Mallarme</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for &lt;I&gt;False Memories&lt;/I&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;It was rich. Like eating a large slice of cheese cake with blueberry topping. I finished reading it today-did what it was suppose to do-kept my interest, created a deeper mystery surrounding the artist, brought up controversy, cleared a few questions, and much, much more. This will be a book, not just for collectors, but for anyone wanting to know a little about the psyche of a painter. Brilliant!&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p align=right&gt;-Lynn Vermillion&lt;/p align=right&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;False memories&lt;/I&gt; is a psychologist&#39;s term for memories cleverly and conveniently created by the subconscious mind. Since the theory of reincarnation is not widely accepted, we tend to explain away memories of previous lives as false memories. Contemporary American painter Anton Brzezinski would be the first to agree that his own memories of previous lives are productions of his prodigious imagination-but Brzezinski&#39;s memories of his own experiences need no exaggeration to make them fascinating. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;False Memories: Adventures of the Living Dali&lt;/I&gt;, with the exception of the pseudo-author Gabrielle Mallarm, people who appear as characters in this book are not fictitious. This is a work of fiction, but even the wildest incidents described here really occurred!&lt;/P&gt;" />
