  <title>On the Road 2 Recover - Jennifer D. Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Proverbs 31: 10 &quot;For who can find a virtous woman, for her price is far above rubies.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Based upon the struggles of a young woman in ministry, who as a single mother is faced with the obstacles of bad relationships, disabled children, and hypocrisy in the church. Just when you think you are all alone, God always steps in and lets us know that we are never alone. God has blessed me with so many great people to help me face and survive every experience in my life, so that I didnt have to feel alone. I didnt understand all that he was doing while going through, but each process I endured, I came out with a praise. This book has helped me to heal wounds of the past, which I unconsciously suppressed for so many years. While in the process of desiring to heal others and help them begin a journey down the Road to Recover, God has now restored me. God helped me to understand that as you travel down the road of life, I had to travel One Way, and thats Gods way. I have done things my way for so long that I now realize Im not Ms. Burger King, I cant have everything my way. There are some roads that you will come to in life that will have a Caution sign and thats a major clue to Do not enter. One bad decision in life can cost a lifetime of pain and suffering. As you come to the crossroads in you life, slowdown and stop or else you may come to a dead end. As you began to travel the road, just remember if you began to get weak, God is there is carry you the remaining distance of the way. May heaven forever smile upon you always!&lt;br /&gt;
