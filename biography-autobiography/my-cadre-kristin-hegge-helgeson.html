  <title>My Cadre - Kristin Hegge Helgeson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Cadre is a personal memoir about a nurse practitioners spiritual journey as she transitioned from traditional, Western based medicine to her private holistic nursing practice.  Written in a rare and authentic voice, the author tells of her passion to become a spiritual healer.  Through her diligent training in yoga and meditation she learned and practiced kundalini-based tantric meditation methods that opened her to a dimensional realm not of this world.  During her meditations she met and experienced healing techniques with Masters, Angels, Guides and the Great Mother that later manifested in her healing room.  The author carefully weaves the story of how she became the medium and point of energetic transfer between the higher dimensional Beings of Light, her Cadre, whom she met in her meditations and worked side by side with in her healing room, and their combined ministrations to the beloved clients who came into her healing room.  This remarkable and fascinating story encourages us to remember the importance of developing intuitive awareness as a tool for spiritual growth, and invites readers to see how a commitment to deep meditative practices can unlock the door to spiritual awakening." />
