  <title>Patrick: the Irish Immigrant - Brenna O’Shea Cagiano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Patrick: The Irish Immigrant&lt;/I&gt; is the story of a determined Irish lad who
dreamed of a better life of opportunities in America. By the age of
seventeen, Patrick J. O&#39;Shea had saved enough money to buy
passage to the United States. Upon his arrival in New York City,
Patrick used his ambition and determination, mixed with a dash of
Irish malarkey, to set himself up with a job and a new life. This
recipe served him well throughout his adventures that led him
from New York City to the Territory of Hawaii and throughout the
world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Patrick married the love of his life, Arabell.
Together they raised their family against the backdrop of World
War II and other life-changing historical events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick&#39;s life story is the universal story of many immigrants to the
United States of America. He came, he prospered, and he proudly
became a U.S. citizen. Patrick wanted his story told to encourage
others to persevere despite obstacles and setbacks, to do one&#39;s best
at any task, and to always conduct oneself with honor and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
