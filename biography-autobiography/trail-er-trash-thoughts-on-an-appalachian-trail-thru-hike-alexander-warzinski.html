  <title>Trail-er Trash: Thoughts On an Appalachian Trail Thru-hike - Alexander Warzinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I knew I would hike the Appalachian Trail. My dad took me on my first backpacking trip when I was 16, and I instantly fell in love. Backpacking isn&#39;t easy, but it&#39;s simple. Perfectly simple. I draw extreme pleasure from being able to survive with nothing but what I can carry on my back. You establish a baseline of comfort, and from there you are free to wander and wonder. Something in my 16-year-old head understood that thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail was the ultimate backpacking experience. After years of talking about it in high school and college to extremely patient friends, I was excited and frantically planning during my final semester at school to finally get underway. I&#39;m pleased to say I hiked all 2,185.3 miles from Springer Mountain, Georgia to Mount Katahdin, Maine from May 24th-Sep. 27th, 2014. This ebook is the fullest written representation  of the trail I can give." />
