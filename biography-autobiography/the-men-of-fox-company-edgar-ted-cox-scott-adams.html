  <title>The Men of Fox Company - &quot;Edgar &quot;&quot;Ted&quot;&quot;&quot; Cox, Scott Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Men of Fox Company: History and Recollections of Company F, 291st Infantry Regiment, Seventy-Fifth Infantry Division&lt;/i&gt; describes the actions of an infantry rifle company fighting in Europe during World War II. Sometimes the Seventy-Fifth Division was called the Diaper Division because the mean age of the men was just twenty-two years versus the widely acknowledged average age of twenty-six years for most other divisions. Fox Company was part of Second Battalion, 291st Infantry Regiment of the Seventy-Fifth ID, which were formally activated at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, on April 15, 1943.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division was thrown into combat soon after arriving in Europe in December of 1944. Over the next ninety-four days, they fought three campaigns in Europe. Fox Company first went into combat during the Battle of the Bulge and then moved to southern France to fight in the Colmar Pocket. Next, they went to Holland, where they defended along the Maas River and later in Germany along the Rhine River. Finally, Fox Company fought in the battle for the Ruhr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Men of Fox Company includes the recollections of several men providing a view of the war not often seendirectly from the soldiers, sergeants, and officers who survived the experience to tell their personal stories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
