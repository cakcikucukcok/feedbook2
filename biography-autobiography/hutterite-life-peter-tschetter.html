  <title>Hutterite Life - Peter Tschetter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reflections
Reading Peter Tschetter&#39;s book Hutterite Life is a personal reminiscent collection of stories of a generation living during transition times to a more convenient way of living on the prairie of South Dakota. One can get a gimpse of the living conditions of that generation whether one was in communal living or in community living. 
Peter has expressed believing that a Christ-centered life is lived by allowing the Holy Spirit of God to move one to live in a way that show&#39;s God&#39;s grace. That a Christ-centered life mst reflect a heart filled with the testimony of Jesus of those who claim His name---thereby giving real meaning to their own being. 
&quot;Pete&quot;, as affectionately known, has expressed a desire to write down more stories of his childhood. His rich eperiences and also those involved should be read and not fall forgotten to the ages. I encourage him and the Hutterite people to share their life of communal living in this unique American sub-culture.
