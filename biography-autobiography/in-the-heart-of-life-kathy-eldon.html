  <title>In the Heart of Life - Kathy Eldon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Mother Loses Almost Everything Before She Discovers True Joy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1977, Kathy Eldon moved with her husband and two children from England to Kenya, where she found freedom as she had never known it before and was ready to push back from her old, restrictive life. Diving into this tumultuous new world as a journalist and writer, she embraced the energy and creativity of Kenyans, both black and white. But her world collapsed when her twenty-two-year-old son, Dan&amp;#8212;an artist and photojournalist on assignment for Reuters&amp;#8212;was stoned to death by an angry mob in Somalia, killed by the very people he was trying to help. Kathy&#39;s journey through this tragic loss was deeply spiritual as she discovered that, in many ways, Dan was still ever-present in her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gripping international saga includes a passionate love, a dangerous coup in Kenya, and a compelling glimpse into a woman on the brink of self-discovery. After her son&#39;s murder, Kathy began to publish his art, which gained popularity worldwide and&amp;#8212;together with her daughter, Amy&amp;#8212;launched a global foundation celebrating Dan&#39;s work as a creative activist. Throughout Kathy&#39;s exploration of profound tragedy, we find the secrets to not only surviving, but being truly, gloriously alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
