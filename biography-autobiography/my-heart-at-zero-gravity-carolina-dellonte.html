  <title>My Heart at Zero Gravity - Carolina Dellonte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ten years spent zipping through the sky, chasing a deep passion for flying, for limitless spaces, for horizons that are wider when observed from great heights. The author recounts her experiences as a civil pilot, describing unexpected encounters and revealing both the background of a traditionally fascinating and intriguing job as well as its darker sides, like her efforts to make her way as a woman at the controls of an airplane or the small and large battles to be faced every day to overcome the problems and hostilities of a complex and compelling profession. Giving her a helping hand is her love for her work, the awareness of knowing how to do it well and, in the end, the courage to make a painful but necessary choice.&lt;br /&gt;
The thin, elegant wings of a Piaggio P180 allow the author to rise above the earthly shadows, transporting the reader into a story written with freshness and a sincere heart, without artifices, through a series of adventures that are both entertaining and evocative. A narrative that is also a vital inspiration for learning to never give up." />
