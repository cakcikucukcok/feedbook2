  <title>Random Reflections of a Looney Bin - Gordon Kerkham Rn Rnms Rpn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gordon Kerkham knows that some people will be offended by the term looney bin, but in his opinion, thats what they were and what they areand as such, thats what they should be called. Too many professional mental healthcare centres, in his experience, are little more than dumping grounds for the people we dont want to see or acknowledge in our worldthose living with mental illness or intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As a nurse, director of nursing, consultant, and head of professional health education at a university, he has earned his opinion of the system. In Random Reflections of a Looney Bin, he lifts the veil that surrounds an area that most people are not willing to explore. Offering passage into a hidden world, this memoir shares his memories of life in a variety of mental healthcare facilities and his work with aged, handicapped, and psychiatric patients.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;He writes in what he calls true myth style, meaning his reflections represent mostly the truth with some of the folklore and myth that accumulates through time. His aim is to show that these events all happenedand are still happening today in many parts of the civilised world. In his own experience and in those shared by caregivers in other locations, he has concluded that regardless of location, these facilities have more in common than most might want to believe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
