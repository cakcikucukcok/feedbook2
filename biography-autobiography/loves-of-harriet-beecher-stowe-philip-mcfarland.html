  <title>Loves of Harriet Beecher Stowe - Philip Mcfarland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;So this is the little woman who wrote the book that made this big war!&quot; Abraham Lincoln is reputed to have said when he met the author of &lt;I&gt;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&lt;/I&gt; on the eve of the Emancipation Proclamation. Harriet Beecher Stowe&#39;s groundbreaking novel forced an ambivalent North to confront the atrocities of slavery, yet it was just one of many accomplishments of the Beechers, the most eminent American family of the nineteenth century.&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Historian Philip McFarland follows the Beecher clan to the boomtown of Cincinnati, where Harriet&#39;s glimpses of slavery across the Kentucky border moved her to pen &lt;I&gt;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&lt;/I&gt;. We meet Harriet&#39;s loves: her father Lyman, her husband Calvin, and her brother Henry, the most famous preacher of his time. As McFarland leads us through Harriet&#39;s ever-changing world, he traces the arc of her literary career from her hard-scrabble beginnings to her ascendancy as the most renowned author of her day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Through the portrait of a defining American family, &lt;I&gt;Loves of Harriet Beecher Stowe&lt;/I&gt; opens into an unforgettable rendering of mid-nineteenth century America in the midst of unprecedented social and demographic explosions. To this day, &lt;I&gt;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&lt;/I&gt; reverberates as a crucial document in Western culture.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
