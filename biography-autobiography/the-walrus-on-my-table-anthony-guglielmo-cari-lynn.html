  <title>The Walrus on My Table - Anthony Guglielmo, Cari Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, massage therapist Anthony Guglielmo got a call for a strange appointment.  &quot;Will you massage my horse?,&quot; one of his clients asked.  And so began Anthony&#39;s strange and wonderful adventure into the world of animal massage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Walrus on My Table&lt;/i&gt;, enter a world where dolphins line up to take turns for their massages, beluga whales lean in for better contact, and high-strung horses grow calm and manageable under Anthony&#39;s soothing touch.  Discover animal friends you will never forget.  Meet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nuka, the 1,800 lb. walrus.  A series of injections left Nuka&#39;s muscles severely constricted on one side of her body, and this gentle animal could no longer swim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Molly and Josephine, two playful elderly dolphins. Though at first reluctant to allow Anthony&#39;s touch, by their second session these two line up impatiently, eager for his attention.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Mambo Point, a racehorse who just couldn&#39;t win.  Mambo&#39;s owner knew that this horse had potential... so why wasn&#39;t he performing up to his ability? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Rudy, the hump-backed penguin who wasn&#39;t expected to live. Born with a life-threatening condition that made breathing difficult, Rudy&#39;s future looked uncertain...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Reddog, who loved to sleep on his owners&#39; forbidden bed-until a sprain got him caught in the act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Mickey, an independent Tabby, who relaxes so completely under Anthony&#39;s hands, she topples right over!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Tab and Presley, the prankster bachelor dolphins of the aquarium, who love to play tricks on their trainers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Baby, the recipient of the first ever shark massage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, dive in and romp with Nuka and friends...and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
