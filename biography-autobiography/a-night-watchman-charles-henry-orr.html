  <title>A Night Watchman - Charles Henry Orr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The journey of sixty-five years old for an African American male in the United
States has been a rough and rocky endeavor. A discussion of four major topics
of great importance today is critical in explaining the most important factors in
the life of Charles Henry Orr. Father-and-Son Relationships help explain how
Charles and his father interacted and cared about one another in a time where
survival was a challenge. Becoming a man and/or developing into manhood
were not a fast process for Charles; some of the reasons will be highlighted in
this book. The importance of education came to him slow as well and will be
explained. The role of dignity and respect in both of their lives had negative
effects relative to their accomplishments in life.
Fortunately, Charles is still alive and working on some accomplishments
that will contribute to society after he is gone. Soichiro, the founder of Honda,
said, To me success can only be achieved through repeated failure and
introspection. In fact, success represents 1% of your work that results from the
99% called failure. Charles Orr has lived through many failures in life, but
the point here is he has always worked on being successful. Webster defines
success as favorable outcomes of desired goals and/or becoming wealthy or
famous. Charles has been successful on the desired outcomes of some of his
goals, but being wealthy and famous is not included. Drawing from Hornsbys
(2004) article titled African Americans in order to put Charless story in a
historical perspective, there are thirty-five million black Americans living
in the United States, accounting for 12 percent of the total population. They
basically came from Western Africa. Without the use of genealogy research,
Charles is sure he is in this group." />
