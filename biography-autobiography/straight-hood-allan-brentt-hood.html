  <title>Straight Hood - Allan Brentt Hood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a compilation of short stories about my life and certain experiences I&#39;ve had. They cover issues such as race, faith, addiction, the mistreatment of women, and overall degradation of moral values. It addresses certain immoral principles and poses questions to make people think and hold themselves accountable for their actions and the image they portray to the world. They&#39;re meant to question some of the norms of our society, as well as give people some insight into who I am and how I developed the opinions that I did. My hope is that they will be a positive example for children and all people, not only of the present, but also the future. The ultimate goal is to set a better standard for the youth so that they won&#39;t be negatively impacted by the corruption that I feel has permeated its way through the system." />
