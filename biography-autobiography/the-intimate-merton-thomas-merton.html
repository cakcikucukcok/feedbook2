  <title>The Intimate Merton - Thomas Merton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this diary-like memoir, composed of his most poignant and insightful journal entries, &lt;em&gt;The Intimate Merton&lt;/em&gt; lays bare the steep ways of Thomas Merton&#39;s spiritual path. Culled from the seven volumes of his personal journals, this twenty nine year chronicle deepens and extends the story Thomas Merton recounted and made famous in &lt;em&gt;The Seven Storey Mountain.&lt;/em&gt; This book is the spiritual autobiography of our century&#39;s most celebrated monk -- the wisdom gained from the personal experience of an enduring spiritual teacher. Here is Merton&#39;s account of his life&#39;s major challenges, his confrontations with monastic and church hierarchies, his interaction with religious traditions east and west, and his antiwar and civil-rights activities. In &lt;em&gt;The Intimate Merton&lt;/em&gt; we engage a writer&#39;s art of &quot;confession and witness&quot; as he searches for a contemporary, authentic, and global spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recounting Merton&#39;s earliest days in the monastery to his journey east to meet the Dalai Lama, &lt;em&gt;The Intimate Merton&lt;/em&gt; captures the essence of what makes Thomas Merton&#39;s life journey so perennially relevant.&lt;/p&gt;" />
