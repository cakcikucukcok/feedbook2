  <title>Reflections - Bonnie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bonnie has had more than her share of setbacks. All told, she has had almost thirty major operations that could have been fatal. To put everything into perspective, she needed to reflect on her life by telling about and writing about her situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still believe that Bonnie has gotten through these situations because she was never at fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since she was a child, she has been faced with problems that she had no control over. This is a tribute to her amazing mental strength. I myself learned to be stronger through her. I thank her for this.&lt;/p&gt;
