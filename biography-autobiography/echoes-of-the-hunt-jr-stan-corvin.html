  <title>Echoes of the Hunt - Jr. Stan Corvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Hunt&lt;/em&gt;, written by Stan Corvin, Jr., is the true story of a deer hunt he was on a few years ago in West Texas.&amp;nbsp; Arriving at the ranch, he learned the owner who invited him had the flu and was not going to participate in the hunting of a massive atypical mule deer named &amp;ldquo;El Viejo.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; For the next ten days, Stan hunted alone for the trophy buck. Interwoven with this adventure, he tells of hunting experiences as a young boy, then later as a teenager with his father, grandfather, and uncle.&amp;nbsp; Many of these memories are recalled in the evening while he is sitting in a creaking rocking chair in front of a blazing fireplace while drinking his favorite beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lifelong hunter, Stan has shot dove in Argentina, quail in Baja California, elk in New Mexico, mule deer in Colorado and feral hogs in Texas.&amp;nbsp; As a two-tour helicopter pilot serving in Vietnam in 1968 and 1971, he also hunted NVA and Vietcong enemy soldiers. That memoir is told in his third book, V&lt;em&gt;ietnam Saga: Exploits of a Combat Helicopter Pilot&lt;/em&gt; published in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;" />
