  <title>&quot;Why Don&#39;t You Like Me Daddy?&quot; - Carl A. Farmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why Dont You Like Me, Daddy? is a courageous story about the cause and effects of physical and verbal child abuse. The cause is most likely from bipolar disorder; The Effects are explained by the  author and the many behaviors that lead up to his diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereotyping mental illness is bullying in the authors opinion. His hope is if you ever need someone to talk to that you seek some consultation. Consultation can be very healthy in any situation, friend, colleague, professional, but you should never be afraid to express how you are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Authors father had proud moments of him throughout his life but his father never liked him and he will never know why. So how do you deal with that? The author explains how he is dealing with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the authors hope that if you are bipolar or have PTSD that you stay on your medication until you are better. If you know someone that has experienced these situations it is hoped that you will understand them a little better.&lt;/p&gt;" />
