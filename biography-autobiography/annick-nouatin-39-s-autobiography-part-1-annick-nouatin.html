      <meta name="description" content="This book is about Annick Nouatins life. She is from West Africa, France, and America. She experienced some traumatic situations, including sexual abuse from her father, alcohol and drug use, the deaths of her parents and two siblings, and two attempts at suicide. In her early years, she was a lost child, because of those difficult experiences. With the help of God, Annick Nouatin learned to rise above her traumas. &lt;br&gt;
	When Annick Nouatin came to Chicago, she was exposed to more difficult situations that made her into a spiritual woman. Those periods of her life made her stronger and stronger. Her introverted nature made her work on herself. Now, she knows her purpose in life.&lt;br&gt;" />
