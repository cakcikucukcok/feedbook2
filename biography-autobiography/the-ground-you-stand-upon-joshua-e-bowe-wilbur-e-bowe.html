  <title>The Ground You Stand Upon - Joshua E Bowe, Wilbur E Bowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Ground You Stand Upon is about my father&amp;rsquo;s life as an infantryman in the Republic of Vietnam from 1966 to 1967, and the men he served with. My father is Wilbur E. Bowe.&amp;nbsp; He was twenty years old and living on his family&amp;#39;s farm when he was drafted in 1965.&amp;nbsp; He was trained at Fort Carson, Colorado, and assigned to the mortar platoon of Alpha Company, 5th Battalion, 7th Calvary (A Co, 5/7th Cav).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 5/7th Cavalry was formed as a brand-new battalion in order to fill out the 1st Air Cavalry Division&amp;rsquo;s 3rd Brigade.&amp;nbsp; The young men of the battalion were largely drafted together in 1965 as the build-up of regular Army forces in Vietnam had just begun. Amongst their career NCOs, almost none had been to Vietnam, but several had served in the Korean War.&amp;nbsp; Together, these impossibly young men would be trained in airmobile infantry tactics and become what were known as &amp;ldquo;skytroopers.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; They would then be sent into the Central Highlands of Vietnam, where together they would learn what &amp;ldquo;search and destroy&amp;rdquo; meant, and face the reality of this new war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story features many of the letters and photographs my dad sent home from the war zone.&amp;nbsp; His dispatches were sent from some of the most remote valleys and outposts in Vietnam, written under the most austere of conditions, often scribbled in haste before another mission, or by flashlight, under a poncho in the rain. &amp;nbsp;They would travel over 8,000 miles across the ocean, to be placed in a mailbox that stood across from a farmhouse, along a rural county road in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many former skytroopers of Alpha Company were interviewed for this story, and their personal accounts recall much of the humor and friendship they shared, along with the sadness and tragedy that would accompany a year spent in the jungles of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story also draws upon the 5/7th Cavalry&amp;rsquo;s daily staff journals and situation reports gathered from the National Archives for every day of the battalion&amp;rsquo;s first year in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is their story, told in great detail from their time spent training together at Fort Carson &amp;ndash; through their historic journey across the ocean aboard the USNS Gaffey, where they would encounter a massive typhoon &amp;ndash; through their many battles fought together in Vietnam &amp;ndash; and eventually, their final patrol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title was inspired by the words of John H. Secondari in the 1965 film, The Saga of Western Man: &amp;ldquo;It is a different type of country than we&amp;rsquo;ve ever fought in.&amp;nbsp; Now flat and sunken with rice paddies, now rolling with hills and meadows, now mountainous and steep.&amp;nbsp; It is hot, it is humid, it is thick with plants and vines.&amp;nbsp; It is largely unpopulated, and in the military sense, it belongs to no one.&amp;nbsp; Not to Viet Cong who roam it, not to the South Vietnamese.&amp;nbsp; It is no man&amp;rsquo;s land.&amp;nbsp; In Vietnam today, you will hold only the ground you stand upon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
