  <title>Winter Journal - Paul Auster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is where the story begins, in your body and everything will end in the body as well.&quot; &lt;br&gt;On January 3, 2011, exactly one month before his sixty-fourth birthday, internationally acclaimed novelist Paul Auster sat down and wrote the first entry of &lt;i&gt;Winter Journal&lt;/i&gt;, his unorthodox, beautifully wrought examination of his own life, as seen through the history of his body. Auster takes us from childhood to the brink of old age as he summons forth a universe of physical sensation, of pleasures and pains, moving from the awakening of sexual desire as an adolescent to the ever deepening bonds of married love, from meditations on eating and sleeping to the &quot;scalding, epiphanic moment of clarity&quot; in 1978 that set him on a new course as a writer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
