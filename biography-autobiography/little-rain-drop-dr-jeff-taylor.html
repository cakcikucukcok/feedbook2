  <title>Little Rain Drop - Dr. Jeff Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dreams do still come true. It happened to Jeff Taylor, who ventured thousands of miles from Texas to China to greet an immeasurable treasure that awaited hima tiny daughter who would soon take possession of his entire heart. In his memoir &lt;i&gt;Little Rain Drop,&lt;/i&gt; Taylor shares the events, emotions, and experiences that accompanied his pilgrimage through international adoption and first-time fatherhood.&lt;p&gt;
With candid emotion, a bit of humor, and wide-eyed wonder, Taylor begins by chronicling his life before adoption, including a battle with infertility, and continues by narrating his poignant journey across the ocean that would culminate in connecting two families and the arrival of his daughter to his home. As he details the emotions, courage, obstacles, and joy that he and his wife Debbie experienced throughout their journey to parenthood, he shares a story of love, hope, and a glimpse at Gods providence. &lt;p&gt;
While providing details beneficial to any couple considering international adoption, Taylor offers a powerful glimpse into the deep emotions that accompany a journey that began with heartache and longing and ended with the realization that the most profound desires of the heart always live on." />
