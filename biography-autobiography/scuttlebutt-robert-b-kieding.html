  <title>Scuttlebutt - Robert B. Kieding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For years, Robert B. Kieding has shared his nautical knowledge with the residents of Santa Barbara, California, in his weekly column in the &lt;i&gt;Santa Barbara News-Press.&lt;/i&gt; Now, with &lt;i&gt;Scuttlebutt: Tales and Experiences of a Life at Sea,&lt;/i&gt; he brings his wit and wisdom to people across the country and around the globe.
At sea, the scuttlebutt was a cask with an opening called a scuttle, around which crewmembers would gather and chat when weather or the captains law allowed. It functioned in much the same manner as our modern-day office watercolora place to share and exchange workplace chatter and stories of dubious provenance. Eventually, the term scuttlebutt came to mean shipboard rumors or gossip. 
In this tradition, &lt;i&gt;Scuttlebutt&lt;/i&gt; covers a wide range of marine-related topicseverything from boating history to sage seafaring advice to humorous personal anecdotes. Kiedings warm and engaging writing style and his obvious love of all things nautical will make this collection appeal to boaters and land lovers alike." />
