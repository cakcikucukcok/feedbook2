  <title>In All Sincerity, Peter Cushing - Christopher Gullo, Neil Vokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In All Sincerity... Peter Cushing
by Christopher Gullo
with a foreword by Peter Sasdy
In All SincerityPeter Cushing is a new book examining the career of the
gentle man of horror. In a career spanning six decades and many mediums,
including film, television, theatre, radio, and writing, Peter Cushing
has been hailed as a consummate actor who was loved by both fans and
co-workers alike. Whether through his early days touring with Laurence
Olivier, becoming Englands first television star, recreating the
characters of Baron Frankenstein and Abraham Van Helsing for Hammer
Films, or appearing in Star Wars, the most famous science fiction film
ever produced, Peter Cushing exemplified dignity, preparedness and
dedication to his craft.
Four years in the making, In All SincerityPeter Cushing breaks down the
actors career into decades from his very beginnings in local theatre,
his stint in Hollywood, and his rise to fame as the king of horror and
beyond. Over eighty actors, actresses and directors have contributed to
the book, including Val Guest, Robert Quarry, Francis Matthews, Brian
Cox, Forrest J. Ackerman, Yvonne Monlaur, Mark Hamill, John Carpenter,
Ted Newsom, Caroline Munro and the late Sir Nigel Hawthorne. Featuring
dozens of pictures, In All SincerityPeter Cushing includes some rare
candid and never before published photos of Peter Cushing on the sets of
The Curse of Frankenstein, The Gorgon, The Skull, Frankenstein
Created Woman, and Tendre Dracula, at leisure; indulging in his love
of painting, the 1975 Famous Monsters convention and the 1992 opening of
Cushings View. Also featured is a dedication from his life-long love
Helen Beck six months before their marriage. In All SincerityPeter
Cushing offers fans a personal look at a truly talented man.
Author Christopher Gullo has been a life-long admirer of actor Peter
Cushing. He has spent the last four years collecting rare materials and
conducting interviews with Cushings co-workers for his research on the
book. In the beginning of 2000, he took over the running of The Peter
Cushing Association, a club for all fans of the great actor, which was
created under the guidance of Peter Cushings former secretary, Joyce
Broughton.
YOU COULD OWN A GENUINE PIECE OF PETER CUSHING MEMORABILIA:
Author Christopher Gullo is offering all fans who order the book and e-mail him at cgullo@juno.com (including their name, mailing address, and e-mail address) the chance to win an actual letter written by Peter Cushing to the BBC in 1986. It is on a piece of Mr. Cushings official stationery, written on both sides, and signed by him. All names and addresses will be kept on file, and at the time of the books publication will be entered into a draw - the first one drawn will win Peter Cushings letter." />
