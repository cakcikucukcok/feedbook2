  <title>What Reagan Couldn&#39;t Tell Us - Lawrence Nesbitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many of Ronald Reagan&#39;s ways were not only unusual, but seem to contradict his others.  Some authors are so perplexed by his nature they are reluctant to even assign intelligence to his mentality.  They suspect he operated on everything from instinct to hunches to gut feelings and guesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Nesbitt&#39;s six years of extensive research has revealed a single psychological key that makes sense of the anomalies and contradictions.  He has uncovered a powerful and nearly unique mindset that directed almost all of Reagan&#39;s conduct then and causes the confusion now.  This unusual belief also explains how a man so old and riddled with flaws could accomplish so much and leave the presidency with an approval rating of nearly 70%, the highest of any two-term president in United States history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nesbitt shows the controlling role this mindset played in Reagan&#39;s youth, in his years as a Hollywood actor, during his tenure as California governor, through his two terms as president, and even later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Reagan Couldn&#39;t Tell Us&lt;/i&gt; offers a previously untold analysis of Reagan, one that will encourage discussion for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
I found Lawrence Nesbitts explanation of what made Ronald Reagan tick very plausible, fascinating, and enlightening. His revolutionary conclusions about the former president seem well-founded on solid evidence. He gives us a new Reagan to appreciate.
