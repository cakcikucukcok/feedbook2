  <title>Moving On - Paul LeBlanc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ive been home for eight years. (What a mistake I made. You have no idea.) I have had a stroke sometime ago. But thanks to Louise, my wife (I got married in 2007), I am coming back to myself, writing this book about my experience, and getting better all the time.
   I have no inhibitions about writing what has happened. I met a man here, and it was a disaster. His family wont talk to him; his son had a son and refused to let the grandson see him. His ex-wife wont talk to him at all. He took great pleasure in doing things to people. However, I digress. I am going to tell you about all the films that I worked on since that fateful day, when I won an Oscar." />
