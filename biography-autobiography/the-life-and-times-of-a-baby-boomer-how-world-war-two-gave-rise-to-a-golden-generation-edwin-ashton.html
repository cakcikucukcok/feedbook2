  <title>The Life and Times of a Baby Boomer: How World War Two Gave Rise to a Golden Generation - Edwin Ashton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Life and Times of a Baby Boomer will make you laugh, but it should also make you angry. Part memoir, part philosophical musing, and part political-economy this book describes how The Baby Boomer generation experienced a life previously unknown by workers at any time before in history. It will take you on a journey through the Golden Age of Britain from 1945 to the neo-liberal economic catastrophe of the twenty first century as seen through the eyes of a Baby Boomer. Beginning with the origin of a Post War Consensus that couldn&#39;t be destroyed by those on the political right, it tells of the fracturing of that consensus and how Capital only needed to wait for an opportunity in order to reverse all the gains that workers had achieved post 1945. The book weaves humour and sadness in the life of a baby boomer in changing times, and along the way explores the flaws in neo-liberal economics." />
