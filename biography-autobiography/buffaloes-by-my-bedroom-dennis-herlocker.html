  <title>Buffaloes by My Bedroom - Dennis Herlocker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dennis Herlocker traveled to Tanganyika as a Peace Corps volunteer expecting to work in a village resettlement program.  Instead, he became a forester in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which includes the world-famous Ngorongoro Crater and the eastern Serengeti Plains.  He spent the next three years working in one of the most spectacular and interesting places in the world.
	It was a wonderful place of dramatic landscapes, milling herds of migratory herbivores, and Maasai pastoralists who lived much as they had hundreds of years ago.  Dennis had close (and sometimes scary) encounters with wildlife.  His colleagues were an intriguing mix of national and ethnic groups.  He fell in love and married.  It was the most enjoyable time of his life.
	Come along on the adventure of a lifetime and discover the beauty and excitement of an Africa that can only be discovered by living amongst her people and places." />
