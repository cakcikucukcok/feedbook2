  <title>The Biography of Imam Master Sayyed Ahmad Al-Rifai Establisher of the Rifai Sufi Path [(512 Ah)(1118 Ad)]-[(578 Ah)(1182 Ad)] - Sayyed Yousuf Sayyed Hashem Al-Rifai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sayyed Ahmad Al-Rifai is among the best of the divinely devoted scholars, and the great masters (sheikhs) in the Muslim nation (ummah), the nation of Muhammad, may Allahs peace and blessings be upon him. He is among those pure and believing souls, for which Allah has written the general acceptance and complete approach, and whose reputation exceeded its age and region unto the farthest temporal and spatial and distances. 
It might be that no other sheikh or educating master after Abdul-Qadir Al-Gilani has acquired this great admiration, and widespread acceptance, which master Al-Rifai has acquired. 
His path is still alive, and is placed in the Arab countries as the Jashtiya path is placed here in the Indian subcontinent, and its neighboring country.
