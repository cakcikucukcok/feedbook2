  <title>Counterfeiter and Other Stories - Yasushi Inoue, Leon Picon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;These three stories illustrate Inoue&#39;s versatility, his mastery of detail and his control of narrative structure. Inoue presents the tale as mystery and solution, the tale as psychoanalytic exploration&amp;#133;, the tale as emblematic social history.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Arizona Quarterly&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Counterfeiter&lt;/I&gt;, a writer is commissioned to write the biography of a famous painter but becomes fascinated by a man who produced forgeries of the artist&#39;s work. &lt;I&gt;Obasute&lt;/I&gt; concerns a man&#39;s obsession with a legend of old women being taken to a mountain and abandoned, and his interpretation of the actions of members of his family in light of this legend. &lt;I&gt;The Full Moon&lt;/I&gt; is a story of company politics, particularly the rise and fall of firm&#39;s president, told largely through incidents at annual company parties.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yasushi Inoue was born in 1907. He rose quickly to become one of Japan&#39;s most important contemporary writers, winning almost every major Japanese literary prize. Inoue died in 1991.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
