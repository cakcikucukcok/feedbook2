  <title>Half Gods - Akil Kumarasamy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A startlingly beautiful debut, &lt;i&gt;Half Gods &lt;/i&gt;brings together the exiled, the disappeared, the seekers. Following the fractured origins and destines of two brothers named after demigods from the ancient epic the Mahabharata, we meet a family struggling with the reverberations of the past in their lives. These ten interlinked stories redraw the map of our world in surprising ways: following an act of violence, a baby girl is renamed after a Hindu goddess but raised as a Muslim; a lonely butcher from Angola finds solace in a family of refugees in New Jersey; a gentle entomologist, in Sri Lanka, discovers unexpected reserves of courage while searching for his missing son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turns heartbreaking and fiercely inventive, &lt;i&gt;Half Gods&lt;/i&gt; reveals with sharp clarity the ways that parents, children, and friends act as unknowing mirrors to each other, revealing in their all-too human weaknesses, hopes, and sorrows a connection to the divine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
