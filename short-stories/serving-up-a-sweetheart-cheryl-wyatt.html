  <title>Serving Up a Sweetheart - Cheryl Wyatt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ve helped orchestrate the perfect day for countless couples. Now twelve new couples will find themselves in the wedding spotlight in the second Year of Weddings novella collection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meadow knows how to serve delicious food to match any wedding theme. But can she accept love when it&#39;s served up on a silver platter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During one of the biggest weeks of her catering career, Meadow Larson&amp;rsquo;s kitchen roof caves in after an unrelenting blizzard. She has to accept help from the last person on earth she wants to see: Colin McGrath. The tormentor from her past is now a contractor, her new neighbor&amp;mdash;and the only person available to take on a project of this size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin is aware God has given him a second chance to make things right with Meadow after bullying her in high school. After years of regret and guilt, Colin is determined to earn her respect and forgiveness, no matter what it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll take an extreme kitchen renovation, several cooking lessons, a little lace, and a lot of grace, but God is using this renovation project not only to restore Meadow&amp;rsquo;s heart, but also to restore Colin&amp;rsquo;s integrity in her eyes. Will Meadow learn to trust the new Colin even as their relationship grows from a business exchange to something more meaningful?&lt;/p&gt;" />
