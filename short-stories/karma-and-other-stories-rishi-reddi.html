  <title>Karma and Other Stories - Rishi Reddi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this sparkling collection, award-winning writer Rishi Reddi weaves a multigenerational tapestry of interconnected lives, depicting members of an Indian American community struggling to balance the demands of tradition with the allure of Western life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Lord Krishna,&quot; a teenager is offended  when his evangelical history teacher likens the Hindu deity to Satan, but ultimately forgives the teacher against his father&#39;s wishes. In the title story, &quot;Karma,&quot; an unemployed professor rescues birds in downtown Boston after his wealthy brother kicks him out of his home. In &quot;Justice Shiva Ram Murthy,&quot; which appeared in The Best American Short Stories 2005, an irascible retired judge reconnects with a childhood friend while adjusting to a new life with his daughter and her American husband. In &quot;Devadasi,&quot; a beautiful young woman raised in the United States travels back to India and challenges the sexual confines of her culture. And in &quot;Bangles,&quot; a widow decides to return to her native village to flee her son&#39;s off-putting American ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set mostly in the Boston area, with side trips to an isolated immigrant community in Wichita, Kansas, and the characters&#39; hometown of Hyderabad, India, Karma and Other Stories introduces a luminous new voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
