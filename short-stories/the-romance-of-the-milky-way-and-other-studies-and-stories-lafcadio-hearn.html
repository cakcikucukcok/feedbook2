  <title>The Romance of the Milky Way: and Other Studies and Stories - Lafcadio Hearn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This delightful book presents seven pieces from the rich heritage of Lafcadio Hearn&amp;#8212;one of the first and most preeminent scholars to travel to and write about Japan. They are a natural outgrowth of Hearn&#39;s peerless philosophy: &quot;If you have any feeling&amp;#8212;no matter what&amp;#8212;strongly latent in the mind (even only a haunting sadness or a mysterious joy), you may be sure that it is expressible.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hearn&#39;s language, his incomparable prose, ripened and mellowed consistently to the end, enabling him to write rich, melancholy, and profound passages such as the final paragraph in &lt;I&gt;The Romance of the Milky Way&lt;/I&gt;: &quot;I see the thrill of its shining stream, and the mists that hover along its verge, and the water-grasses that bend in the winds of Autumn. White Orihime I see at her starry loom, and the ox that graces on the farther shore, and I know that the falling dew is the spray from the herdsman&#39;s oar. And the heaven seems very near and warm and human; and the silence about me is filled with the dream of a love unchanging, immortal, fever yearning and forever young, and forever left unsatisfied by the paternal wisdom of the Gods.&quot;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
