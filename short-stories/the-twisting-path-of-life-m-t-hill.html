  <title>The Twisting Path of Life - M. T. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Living is an ongoing learning experiencebut not all lessons are learned in time. Some people (and animals) just dont learn, it seems. One never knows where lifes path leads, and that may be the greatest challenge of being alive. Within, M. T. Hill shares a few of these life adventures, both great and small, and how we are all products of lifetime decisions made on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tippys Tale, a young dogs adventures on the other side of the fence culminate with a ride in an animal control van to the Pound of No Return. But for this spirited runaway, what seems like the end may very well be a bright new beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its every brides worst nightmare, but as one nervous young woman learns in Nuptial Thoughts, not everything is as it seems. Shes been left, not at the altar but at the rehearsal dinner. Can a brides heart learn to love again after its been broken? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both humans and animals alike, life is a series of adventures, challenges, triumphs, and heartbreak. Every life is a story, and here, Hill shares a few of hers. Some are inspired by life, and others are joyful products of her imagination. She explores the dynamic balance behind seemingly small and random decisions and how these moments can change a life forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The many twists and turns of a life may not be as random as they seem, and these characters invite you to join them on their journeys. &lt;/p&gt;" />
