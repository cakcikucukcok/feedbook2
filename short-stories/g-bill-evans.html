  <title>G - Bill Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If there were such a thing as karma, Gregor would say he had itbad karma. His mental illness has been present practically since birth. During early childhood, Gregor already knows hes different. As he grows to be an adult, those differences become violently apparent. He is a monster born, not made, and his extremely disturbed mental state is a thing of nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Told in a series of chilling vignettes, G: The Story of a Madman is a character study of one mans descent into pure evil. It begins with Baby G, a tale of Gregors upbringing. A few years later, run into him again in Friends. Next, follow Gregor to New York City as he escapes his history to start anew in the Big Apple. Finally, the Psycho G series takes readers deepest into the darkness of this antihero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For author Bill Evans, writing is the priceless ability to show the things we dare not think or say in real life. It is a pure art form that reflects the truth of the human condition, no matter how dark and deviant. The stories in G do not pull any punches as Gregor grows to become the monster in all our minds and openly portrays the horrors we refuse to accept.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>G - Bill Evans</i></b> | William John Evans (August 16, 1929 – September 15, 1980) was an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly played in trios. His use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today.<br /><b><i>Bill Evans - Wikipedia</i></b> | Evans returned to the scene as a leader in December 1958 with the album Everybody Digs Bill Evans, which included the famous "Peace Piece," a haunting vamp for solo piano that sounds like a long-lost Satie Gymnopedie.<br /><b><i>Bill Evans | Biography &amp; History | AllMusic</i></b> | Check out Bill Evans on Amazon Music.
