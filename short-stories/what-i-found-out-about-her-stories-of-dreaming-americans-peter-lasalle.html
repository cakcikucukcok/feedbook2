  <title>What I Found Out About Her: Stories of Dreaming Americans - Peter LaSalle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What I Found Out About Her: Stories of Dreaming Americans, winner of the 2014 Richard Sullivan Prize in Short Fiction, reaffirms Peter LaSalle&#39;s reputation as one of the most startlingly original writers working in the short fiction genre today.      In this collection of eleven stories, LaSalle explores how everyday life for many-an FBI agent, a study-abroad student, a drug dealer&#39;s chic girlfriend, a trio of Broadway playwrights, among others-can often take on something much larger than that, almost the texture of a haunting dream. Marked by stylistic daring and a rare lyricism in language, this is intense, thoroughly moving fiction that probes the contemporary American psyche, portraying it in all its frequently painful sadness and also its brave and unflagging hope." />
