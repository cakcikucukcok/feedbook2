  <title>Tales I Have Woven - Elenita Belgica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tales I Have Woven is a collection of short stories that spin around the colorful fabric of life. The common threads of love, search for meaning, human choices, family values, tradition, change, environment, destiny and lifes purpose are intricately contrived into a tapestry that blends into one. 
In The Stone House, Mr. So lived his life following the family values of honor and responsibility. He took care of his fathers textile company and of his aging mother. Polistico was the respected tenor in a little village until the day of a big wedding in the story of Polistico. In Chrysalis the quiet town of Anao woke up hearing a bellowing voice of a strange creature. It was a historical town that whispered and was heard. And in Amapola, the fields of poppies in the valley made people leave and move. It was the restless need to chase and venture towards something that followed them.
As the lives of these characters unfold, Elenita unveils her keen observation in the dynamic power of human sentiments, of love, compassion, purpose, and communal spirit. Tales I Have Woven is a propitious literary debut." />
