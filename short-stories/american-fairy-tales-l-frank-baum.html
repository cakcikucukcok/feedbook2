  <title>American Fairy Tales - L. Frank Baum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="American Fairy Tales is the title of a collection of twelve fantasy stories by L. Frank Baum, published in 1901 by the George M. Hill Company, the firm that issued The Wonderful Wizard of Oz the previous year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
L. Frank Baum was doing well in 1901, better than ever before in his life. He had written two popular books, Father Goose: His Book and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and was determined to capitalize on this success. In addition to American Fairy Tales, Baum&amp;#39;s Dot and Tot of Merryland and The Master Key appeared in 1901.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Publisher George M. Hill sold the serialization rights to the twelve stories in AFT to five major newspapers, the Pittsburgh Dispatch, the Boston Post, the Cincinnati Enquirer, the St. Louis Republic, and The Chicago Chronicle. The stories appeared between March 3 and May 19, 1901; the book followed in October. The first three papers used or adapted the book&amp;#39;s illustrations for their publications of the stories, while the Chronicle and the Republic had their own staff artists do separate pictures." />
