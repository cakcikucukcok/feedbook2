  <title>Cities I&#39;ve Never Lived In - Sara Majka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In subtle, sensuous prose, the stories in Sara Majka&#39;s debut collection  explore distance in all its forms: the emotional spaces that open up  between family members, friends, and lovers; the gaps that emerge  between who we were and who we are; the gulf between our private and  public selves. At the center of the collection is a series of stories  narrated by a young American woman in the wake of a divorce; wry and  shy but never less than open to the world, she recalls the places and  people she has been close to, the dreams she has pursued and those she  has left unfulfilled. Interspersed with these intimate first-person  stories are stand-alone pieces where the tight focus on the narrator&#39;s  life gives way to closely observed accounts of the lives of others. A  book about belonging, and how much of yourself to give up in the pursuit  of that, &lt;i&gt;Cities I&#39;ve Never Lived In &lt;/i&gt;offers stories that reveal, with great sadness and great humor, the ways we are most of all citizens of the places where we cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cities I&#39;ve Never Lived In&lt;/i&gt; is the second book in Graywolf&#39;s collaboration with the literary magazine &lt;i&gt;A Public Space&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
