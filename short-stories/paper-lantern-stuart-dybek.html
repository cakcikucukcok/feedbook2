  <title>Paper Lantern - Stuart Dybek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new collection of short stories by a master of the form with a common focus on the turmoils of romantic love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ready!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aim!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;On command the firing squad aims at the man backed against a full-length mirror. The mirror once hung in a bedroom, but now it&#39;s cracked and propped against a dumpster in an alley. The condemned man has refused the customary last cigarette but accepted as a hood the black slip that was carelessly tossed over a corner of the mirror&#39;s frame. The slip still smells faintly of a familiar fragrance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins &quot;Tosca,&quot; the first in this vivid collection of Stuart Dybek&#39;s love stories. Operatically dramatic and intimately lyrical, grittily urban and impressionistically natural, the varied fictions in &lt;i&gt;Paper Lantern&lt;/i&gt; all focus on the turmoil of love as only Dybek can portray it. An execution triggers the recollection of a theatrical romance; then a social worker falls for his own client; and lovers part as giddily, perhaps as hopelessly, as a kid trying to hang on to a boisterous kite. A flaming laboratory evokes a steamy midnight drive across terrain both familiar and strange, and an eerily ringing phone becomes the telltale signature of a dark betrayal. Each story is marked with contagious desire, spontaneous revelation, and, ultimately, resigned courage. As one woman whispers when she sets a notebook filled with her sketches drifting out to sea, &quot;Someone will find you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;     Some of Dybek&#39;s characters recur in these stories, while others appear only briefly. Throughout, they--and we--are confronted with vaguely familiar scents and images, reminiscent of love but strangely disconcerting, so that we might wonder whether we are looking in a mirror or down the barrel of a gun. &quot;After the ragged discharge,&quot; Dybek writes, &quot;when the smoke has cleared, who will be left standing and who will be shattered into shards?&quot; &lt;i&gt;Paper Lantern&lt;/i&gt; brims with the intoxicating elixirs known to every love-struck, lovelorn heart, and it marks the magnificent return of one of America&#39;s most important fiction writers at the height of his powers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
