  <title>Diary of My Past Lives - Svetlana Miskovic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Diaries of My Past Lives  - Is a collection of short stories inspired by the events from the authors life. They are easily recognized as hospital stories, war related stories, stories from the North and others. Growing up under specific circumstances she has been watching the world under a microscope of her own. So as much as the stories are related to factual events they are, in fact, fiction. One of her significant inspirations is based on letters. Her family and friends have been scattered all over the world and for that reason it became a tradition in her family life to write letters. Using a narrative form, this author speaks about the texture of life and in life, relating to myth and poetics and colors of art as well. Her hospital stories have a specific implication of how womans life is affected by brutal treatment and still unsuccessful medicine to find a cure for cancer. English language is authors second language and that  makes her writing complex, long and slow process.  Her continual sentence polishing and search for adequate wording that corresponds to her native language is an ongoing process. Her major critic is her common-law husband. He is also her editor. His criticism has been an important help by insisting on precision and by that helping her to distance herself from the work and review the work anew. Each story implies a metaphor left for the readers to discover and reflect upon. Experience conveyed in the work hopefully will stir readers emotions and reflection about their own mosaic of events." />
