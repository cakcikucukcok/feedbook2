  <title>Children of God - Lars Petter Sveen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daring and original stories set in New Testament times, from a rising young Norwegian author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lars Petter Sveen&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Children of God &lt;/i&gt;recounts the lives of people on the margins of the New Testament; thieves, Roman soldiers, prostitutes, lepers, healers, and the occasional disciple all get a chance to speak. With language free of judgment or moralizing, Sveen covers familiar ground in unusual ways. In the opening story, a group of soldiers are tasked with carrying out King Herod&#39;s edict to slaughter the young male children in Bethlehem but waver in their resolve. These interwoven stories harbor surprises at every turn, as the characters reappear. A group of thieves on the road to Jericho encounters no good Samaritan but themselves. A boy healed of his stutter will later regress. A woman searching for her lover from beyond the grave cannot find solace. At crucial moments an old blind man appears, urging the characters to give in to their darker impulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Children of God &lt;/i&gt;was a bestseller in Norway, where it won the Per Olov Enquist Literary Prize and gathered ecstatic reviews. Sveen&#39;s subtle elevation of the conflict between light and dark focuses on the varied struggles these often-ignored individuals face. Yet despite the dark tone, Sveen&#39;s stories retain a buoyancy, thanks to Guy Puzey&#39;s supple and fleet-footed translation. This deeply original and moving book, in Sveen&#39;s restrained and gritty telling, brings to light stories that reflect our own time, from a setting everyone knows.&lt;/p&gt;" />
