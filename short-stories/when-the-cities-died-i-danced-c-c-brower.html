  <title>When the Cities Died, I Danced - C. C. Brower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A couple of days after the cities died, I was there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Dancing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether it was appropriate or not, there was no one around to care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had things to celebrate&amp;nbsp;and this was my way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because I and my family were still alive. And perhaps it was a wake for those who weren&amp;#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It wasn&amp;#39;t a sad occasion, but joyous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I made the trip on my recharging electric pedal-bike. Pedal up hills and go as fast as you can down in order&amp;nbsp;to recharge. Meanwhile, you get a lot of exercise. Fresh air and all that. Some sunshine, but not too much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s so much to take in about what happened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was probably another reason I was out there dancing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It took months to figure out what happened. The common description was the dark times, or Dark Age. Whether people wanted to call it a New Dark Age or Second one, depending on how optimistic they were about our future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And it was too easy to blame several generations of politicians and what they used to call the &amp;quot;miltary- industrial complex.&amp;quot; Very little of either left around these days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another reason to celebrate and count your blessings. And dance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What some people have pieced together is that hypersonic ICBM&amp;#39;s with multiple warheads were launched simultaneously by everyone who had them. They had clusters of neutron bombs that were detonated in the atmosphere, leaving little destruction, but killing all life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It stunk for several weeks, but that was about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, and any electronics died, too. Forget your &amp;quot;smart houses.&amp;quot; And Internet. Gone in a literal flash.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But only in bigger cities. That&amp;#39;s all they had to hit. When 90% of your people cluster up together in areas that are just a few miles across, they are easy targets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The bombs were pretty&amp;nbsp;smart, though. They were designed to leave things standing, untouched. Only the people and their pets and any wildlife were eliminated. The buildings were left untouched.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That first time I danced, I only had to make sure I was upwind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nature was hurt, but it continued.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t know that it was really that &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; an age. It wasn&amp;#39;t like we didn&amp;#39;t have lights. Actually, things got back to a new normal pretty quickly. Because the people who survived the attack were pretty&amp;nbsp;independent and used to making do on their own. Farmers, mostly. But some &amp;quot;townies&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;as well. So we had people who could run stores and make things and grow food.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was my reason for dancing. I was thankful. Grateful. To be alive. To have my family. To be able to&amp;nbsp;enjoy this earth.&lt;br /&gt;
