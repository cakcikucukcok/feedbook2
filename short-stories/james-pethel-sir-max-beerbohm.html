  <title>James Pethel - Sir Max Beerbohm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Excerpt from Book:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was shocked this morning when I saw in my newspaper a paragraph&lt;br /&gt;
announcing his sudden death. I do not say that the shock was very&lt;br /&gt;
disagreeable. One reads a newspaper for the sake of news. Had I never met&lt;br /&gt;
James Pethel, belike I should never have heard of him: and my knowledge&lt;br /&gt;
of his death, coincident with my knowledge that he had existed, would&lt;br /&gt;
have meant nothing at all to me. If you learn suddenly that one of your friends is dead, you are wholly distressed. If the death is that of a mere&lt;br /&gt;
acquaintance whom you have recently seen, you are disconcerted, pricked&lt;br /&gt;
is your sense of mortality; but you do find great solace in telling other&lt;br /&gt;
people that you met &amp;quot;the poor fellow&amp;quot; only the other day, and that he was&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;so full of life and spirits,&amp;quot; and that you remember he said&amp;mdash;whatever you&lt;br /&gt;
may remember of his sayings. If the death is that of a mere acquaintance&lt;br /&gt;
whom you have not seen for years, you are touched so lightly as to find&lt;br /&gt;
solace enough in even such faded reminiscence as is yours to offer. Seven&lt;br /&gt;
years have passed since the day when last I saw James Pethel, and that day&lt;br /&gt;
was the morrow of my first meeting with him.&lt;br /&gt;
