  <title>I Know You Are But What Am I? - Heather Birrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;Birrell has a grand eye for the small detail that is the hallmark of a well-made story.&#39; -- &lt;I&gt;The Toronto Star&lt;/I&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kleptomaniacs, convicts, roof-walkers and homicidal hippies: populated as they are with lives both ordinary and extraordinary, Heather Birrell&#39;s stories pull at the sinews of the strange until the strangeness shapes itself into something familiar. At the same time, they mould the day-to-day into something new and wholly unexpected.  Oldrick must come to terms with his ex-girlfriend&#39;s new lover and a belligerent barista in the midst of a smelly garbage strike. Young Misha learns about the complexities of grownup love when his mother is bitten by a stingray. Home-schooled Rational gets a tutor and learns that his &#39;hunker in the bunker&#39; family isn&#39;t quite what he thought it was, and bus-bound Marion, in love with a married man, finds solace in conversation with a convict.  The stories in &lt;I&gt;I know you are but what am I?&lt;/I&gt; are like snow domes &amp;#150; perfect little self-contained worlds that you can hold in your hand, turn upside down, shake until the meaning settles in a hundred different ways. Here are children and adults, men and women, all struggling to define themselves, all searching for ways to belong. This is a lucid, dextrous collection that marks the ascension of a writer to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Heather Birrell&lt;/B&gt;&#39;s stories have been shortlisted for both the Western and National Magazine Awards and have appeared in numerous Canadian literary journals. A frequent book reviewer and winner of the Journey Prize, she also works as a high school teacher and a creative writing instructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
