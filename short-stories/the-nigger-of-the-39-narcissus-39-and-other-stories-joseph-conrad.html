  <title>The Nigger of the &#39;Narcissus&#39; and Other Stories - Joseph Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Nigger of the &#39;Narcissus&#39; and Other Stories&quot; is a collection of seven shorter works by Joseph Conrad. The titular story is the tale of James Wait, a West Indian black sailor on board the merchant ship &#39;Narcissus&#39; who falls ill during a voyage from Bombay to London. In &quot;Youth&quot; we have a semi-autobiographical short story which tells the story of the first voyage of Charles Marlow, the narrator of Conrad&#39;s most famous novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. In &quot;An Outpost of Progress&quot; we find Kayerts and Carlier, two European agents who have been assigned to a remote trading post in the African jungle. In &quot;The Secret Sharer&quot; we have the story of a nameless captain who discovers a stow-away clinging to the side of his ship and secretly brings him aboard and harbors him in his cabin. Also contained in this edition are the following other short stories: &quot;Il Conde&quot;, &quot;The Duel&quot;, and &quot;The Lagoon&quot;. Fans of Conrad will delight in this classic collection of his shorter works." />
