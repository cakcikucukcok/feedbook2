  <title>New Evil Empire - Bill Gertz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Thirty years ago the People&#39;s Republic of China operated a large, ill-equipped and poorly trained military force. Today, China&#39;s People&#39;s Liberation Army, the Communist Party of China&#39;s military arm, is the final arbiter of power in China and has emerged in recent years as a modern, high-technology army equipped with cutting-edge weapons largely developed from the massive theft of U.S. technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The threat posed today by China extends far beyond military power to economic, intelligence, diplomatic, and information capabilities that are focused laser-like on a single strategic objective: Weakening and undermining the United States as a first step in achieving global supremacy under a new world order under communism with Chinese characteristics. &lt;i&gt;New Evil Empire&lt;/i&gt; details the comprehensive threat posed by China and how the United States can take the needed steps to counter the danger. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;New Evil Empire&lt;/i&gt; will reveal how: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• China is promoting a new form of communism with Chinese characteristics that Beijing is spreading around the world to replace free, open and democratic societies. &lt;br&gt;
• American elites in government and academia disastrously underestimated China by falsely betting for decades that conciliatory polices of unfettered trade and engagement with China would produce a benign normal state. To the contrary, China instead emerged as a dangerous nuclear-armed dictatorship that is now advancing its global ambitions beyond China&#39;s borders. &lt;br&gt;
• High technology totalitarianism inside China is being used by Chinese leaders to hold on to power in a political and economic system that is rapidly becoming unstable as a result of pervasive corruption and political repression. &lt;br&gt;
• Space weapons will be deployed in the next few years that are capable of destroying most of the United States&#39; high-value communications, navigation and intelligence satellites. The space arms will provide Beijing with an asymmetric warfare capability known as &quot;assassin&#39;s mace in space&quot; that is an Achilles&#39; heel strategic vulnerability for the United States. &lt;br&gt;
• China&#39;s military and civilian intelligence services are achieving &quot;digital superiority&quot; – cyber espionage and cyber attack capabilities – capable of quickly wrecking havoc on American society through attacks on the U.S. infrastructure and economy. &lt;br&gt;
• China is engaging in economic warfare through systematic technology theft, the acquisition of high-technology companies and the buying up of former government officials and technical experts who indirectly support Beijing&#39;s strategic objectives. &lt;br&gt;
• China is waging propaganda and disinformation warfare -- strategic influence and deception operations -- that are now a central element of Beijing&#39;s repertoire of non-kinetic capabilities targeting the United States. &lt;br&gt;
• China’s coordinated strategic intelligence operations go beyond the collection of secrets to include the systematic subversion and weakening of the United States and its democratic and free market system. &lt;br&gt;
• China is building up its military forces across the range of forces in preparation for a future war with the United States. The weapons include ground forces, ships and submarines, and aircraft. The buildup is highlighted by deployment of nearly a dozen new advanced missiles such as ultra-high speed hypersonic attack weapons. &lt;br&gt;
• A &quot;string of pearls strategy&quot; was adopted by Beijing for developing a global network of military bases and anti-U.S. alliances around the world. The program is being carried out through a Beijing-funded development program called the One Belt, One Road initiative. &lt;br&gt;
• Flashpoints at sea are becoming more volatile, including Beijing&#39;s covert takeover of the South China Sea, coercion and ultimate takeover of democratic Taiwan and pressure against Japan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;New Evil Empire&lt;/i&gt; will present concrete policy proposals designed to confront China&#39;s drive for global supremacy through educating American and world publics to Beijing&#39;s secrets plans and programs.&lt;/div&gt;" />
