  <title>Feminism, the Family, and the Politics of the Closet: Lesbian and Gay Displacement - Allan E. Barsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How has feminism failed lesbianism? What issues belong at the top of a lesbian and gay political agenda? This book answers both questions by examining what lesbian and gay subordination really amounts to. Calhoun argues that lesbians and gays aren&#39;t just socially and politically disadvantaged. The closet displaces lesbians and gays from visible citizenship, and both law and cultural norms deny lesbians and gay men a private sphere of romance, marriage, and the family. - ;Feminism, the Family, and the Politics of the Closet is about placing sexual orientation politics within feminist theorizing. It is also about defining the central political issues confronting lesbian and gay men. The book brings the study of lesbians from the margins of feminist theory to the centre by critiquing the analytic frameworks employed within feminist theory that renders invisible lesbians&#39; difference from heterosexual women. This book also outlines the basic
features of lesbian and gay subordination by exploring the differences between heterosexual dominance and gender and race relations. Throughout, Calhoun aims to re-centre lesbian and gay politics away from concern with sexual regulations and toward concern with the displacement of gays and lesbians from the
public sphere of visible citizenship and from the private sphere of romance, marriage, and family. - " />
