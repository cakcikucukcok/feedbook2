  <title>Greater than Ever - Daniel Doctoroff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The former deputy mayor of New York City tells the story of the city&#39;s comeback after 9/11, offering lessons in resiliency under the most trying of circumstances, and a model for the rejuvenation of any city.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff led New York&#39;s dramatic and unexpected economic resurgence after the September 11 terrorist attacks. With Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he developed a remarkably ambitious five-borough economic development plan to not only recover from the attacks but to completely transform New York&#39;s economy: New neighborhoods were created. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were generated. The largest municipal affordable housing plan in American history was completed. Ground Zero was rebuilt. And New York adopted a pathbreaking sustainability plan.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;None of this was straightforward. New York has some of the most entrenched financial and political interests anywhere, and it has a population that is quick to let its public officials know exactly what is on its mind. Doctoroff&#39;s plans for a New York Olympic Games and a stadium on the West Side crashed and burned, but phoenix-like he engineered the transformation of the city anyway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Greater than Ever&lt;/i&gt; is a bracing adventure--when can-do attitude dove headlong into New York&#39;s unique realpolitik of &quot;fuggedaboutit&quot;--during which the city was changed for the better.&lt;/div&gt;" />
