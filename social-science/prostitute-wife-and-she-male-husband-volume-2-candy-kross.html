  <title>Prostitute Wife and She-Male Husband Volume 2 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Good! I&#39;m glad we got that out of the way. Are you ready for our next client?&quot;     &quot;Next client?&quot; Nikki was exhausted and in pain from the last one.     &quot;Yes, I booked a short session with a client tonight. Go upstairs and freshen up. I can&#39;t have you looking like a whore.&quot; Then she began giggling. &quot;Well, look at that, I made a joke. Now go and freshen up!&quot;    After Nikki freshened up, he came back downstairs. He was still wearing the chastity device. &quot;I have some good news.&quot; Samantha announced. &quot;I am going to take your chastity device off for this session.&quot; She told him.    &quot;Thank you.&quot; Nikki said. The device was hurting somewhat and it was a bit relaxing knowing that he wasn&#39;t going to get any electrical shocks anytime soon. That was a relief. A short lived one, but nonetheless, a relief.    The doorbell rang and Samantha answered it. In walked a tall beautiful woman with black hair and green eyes wearing a tight red dress with no bra on. Her nipples were like gumdrops and were fully erect." />
