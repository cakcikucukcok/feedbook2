  <title>Making the Transition - Irena Kogan, Clemens Noelke, Michael Gebel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After the breakdown of socialism in Central and Eastern Europe, the role of education systems in preparing students for the &quot;real world&quot; changed. Though young people were freed from coercive state institutions, the shift to capitalism made the transition from school to work much more precarious and increased inequality in early career outcomes. This volume provides the first large-scale analysis of the impact social transformation has had on young people in their transition from school to work in Central and Eastern European countries. 
Written by local experts, the book examines the process for those entering the workforce under socialism, during the turbulent transformation years, in the early 2000s, and today. It considers both the risks and opportunities that have emerged, and reveals how they are distributed across social groups. Only by studying these changes can we better understand the long-term impact of socialism and post-socialist transformation on the problems young people in this part of the world are facing today." />
