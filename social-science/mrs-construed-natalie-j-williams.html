  <title>Mrs. Construed - Natalie J Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Construed is a story of the black woman and how she began her saga as being seen as a beautiful companion while sitting on her throne next to her husband, later only to be unfairly portrayed as undesirable in many societies. It further depicts how she has been devalued by others; how her actions and words are often misconstrued; how in some circumstanced she may have inadvertently perpetuated the stereotypes and labels placed of her; and how she has real options in changing the trajectory of her legacy and that of the black community. Mrs. Construed is a fusion of self-enrichment, inspirational, motivational, statistical surprises, contemporary and nostalgic references, teased with historic notes, famous quotes, and dynamic poems. Mrs. Construed has a plan and strategies to change the way black women see other black women and how black women are viewed by society at large. This is done by offering encouragement, affirmations, questions at the end of each day to ponder and share with family and friends, and by demonstrating to others that black women are not so different than other women in their actions but that black women are most often judged and measured by a different yard stick than women of other races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book lets no one off the hook including black women. It does however, show compassion for the struggle and journey of black women with a long list or resources and references in the back of the book for readers to consult regarding all of the issues and topics discussed within the book. I endeavor to help alter people&amp;rsquo;s perspective from seeing life as being a journey to it being an adventure, by helping to modify some of the issues that often stifle and get them stuck in the quick sand and instead onto trampolines that can propel them forward in their lives. Not only to propel black women and men but also all others that seek to learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
