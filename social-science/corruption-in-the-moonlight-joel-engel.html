  <title>Corruption in the Moonlight - Joel Engel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The Moonlight Fire, as it would come to be called, began September 3, 2007— Labor Day —two and a quarter miles from Moonlight Peak in the Plumas National Forest of California’s eastern Sierra Nevada, “southeast of the town of Westwood and northeast of the town of Greenville,” as the fire’s official report would later put it. Though the precise time it broke out at this mile-high elevation on a hot, windy day would become the subject of much serious debate with significant ramifications, it was noted as having been reported at 2:25 PM by the fire prevention technician from her truck parked below the Moonlight Peak lookout tower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The apparent point of origin was on land owned not by the United States Forest Service (USFS), but on adjacent private lands—noted in the report as being on an “east-facing slope in the Cooks Creek drainage” area—for which the owners had sold logging rights on the parcel to Sierra Pacific Industries, one of the country’s largest lumber companies. In turn, SPI had contracted with a long-established mom and pop company, Howell’s Forest Harvesting, to cut the timber and manage the harvest that would have to be completed before snows began in November.
Firefighters arrived quickly and fire suppression aircraft began dropping borate, a retardant, just before three. Southerly winds pushed the fire north- northeast, angling down slope in this mountainous area covered with tinder-dry terrain that hadn’t burned, or been thinned by man, for decades. It advanced as a crowning fire, meaning that the tops of the conifer trees are so close together that they easily ignite, sometimes independently of what the fire is doing on the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By nine that night, when darkness halted any more flights, only about 250 acres had burned, and there was hope a complete conflagration might be averted. But in the morning a cold front brought erratic winds and downdrafts from thunder- cloud cells, making any effective containment measures impossible. By noon, nearly 2,000 acres had burned or were burning, and for several hours that afternoon the firefighters had to cease because the winds and meteorological conditions were too unpredictable. That night the firefighters were prevented from going out by lightning strikes. Some of these strikes may have sparked more blazes. Winds reached twenty-five miles an hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third morning brought more of the same, then worse. Winds from the northeast pushed the fire toward populated areas in Indian Valley, where rugged terrain, wind gusts, and variable meteorology hampered all firefighting. By late afternoon September 5, the blaze had burned more than 22,000 acres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another 6,000 acres went up the next day when firefighters were prevented from accessing huge portions of the steep perimeter. From there the fire burned uninterrupted from Indicator Peak in the north to Rattlesnake Peak in the south, and on the following day began pushing eastward into areas that had been recently thinned, so the fuel load was less dense.
On September 8, the fire detoured in almost a literal circle around the firefighters, rendering them impotent, though fortunately unharmed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By afternoon, wind speeds moved into the high teens, but there was good news: Except for years’ worth of pine needles on the forest floor, the fuel load consisted of fewer trees with greater spacing between them, making the fire less hot and angry. The bad news was that spot fires began breaking out, some of them with the potential to become named fires of their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seventh day brought weather conditions that allowed firefighters to build a fire line up Wildcat Ridge, and the intentional burnout continued downhill until it stopped the fire’s eastward progression; there was nothing now left to burn in front of it. The fire had gotten as big as it was going to get, spreading from Taylor Lake in the south to nearly the Diamond Mountain Motorway in the north.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight more days of intensive firefighting would be needed, aided by lower winds and higher humidity, before the Moonlight Fire could, at 9:15 PM on September 15, be declared officially contained. Fighting it had required 707 firefighters, forty-two engines, eleven fire crews, half a dozen airplanes, eleven bulldozers, and thirty-four water tenders—at a cost to California of $31 million.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’d also been thirty-four injuries, two homes and five outbuildings destroyed—and 65,000 acres of wilderness burned, 42,000 of them on lands owned by the federal government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly two years later, on June 30, 2009, the California Department of Forestry—AKA Cal Fire—and the USFS issued their joint Origin and Cause Investigation report that had been compiled and written by lead Cal Fire investigator Joshua White. Five weeks later, on August 4, White also sent Sierra Pacific Industries and the owners of the land on which the fire had broken out, as well as Howell’s Forest Harvesting and two Caterpillar drivers working for Howell’s, a letter demanding payment of $8.1 million as reimbursement for suppressing and investigating the fire that he’d deemed had been the result of negligence on the part of the dozer drivers. If payment wasn’t received immediately, said the letter, the state would file a lawsuit. Payment, said the letter, was to be issued in two separate checks. The first for $7.7 million should be made payable to the State of California; the second, for $400,000, to the “CDAA Wildland Fire Training and Equipment Fund [WiFITER].”&lt;br&lt;br&gt;Payment was not made. And so, on August 7, 2009, the State of California filed suit against the defendants. Three weeks later the United States of America filed a separate suit for the loss of the forest lands, which had already begun to grow back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the next few months amended complaints were filed, and for the most part the prosecution of this case by the United States Department of Justice attorneys working out of the Eastern District of California, and the Deputy Attorney General of California in Sacramento, was conducted simultaneously, with most of the same (percipient and expert) witnesses and exhibits for both. They were, in fact, nearly congruent cases relying on identical facts uncovered by the same two investigators, one from Cal Fire, one from the USFS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the following three years, it became an increasingly reasonable inference that neither suit would have been filed if not for the fire’s otherwise fragile connection to Sierra Pacific Industries—the only defendant whose pockets could conceivably accommodate such sums as were being sought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With interest, the amount the United States sought would eventually reach more than a billion dollars.&lt;/div&gt;" />
