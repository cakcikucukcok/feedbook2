  <title>Marathon Quest - Martin Parnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2005, during a four-month cycling trip through Africa, Martin Parnell was struck by the power of sport and its ability to bring people together and to bring about change. Five years later, the 55-year-old mining engineer, husband, father and grandfather dedicated a year of his life to run 250 marathons with the aim of raising $250,000 for the charity Right To Play, an international humanitarian organization that reaches out to disadvantaged children around the world. In the end, Martin’s “Marathon Quest 250” raised $320,000 for the charity, and he personally visited 60 schools, inspiring thousands of children to get active in order to help the less fortunate at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with information on technique, gear, nutrition and the challenges facing new and seasoned athletes as they prepare for either regular or ultra-marathons, Martin gives honest and often humorous insight into why an ordinary person would attempt to do something extraordinary, pushing themselves to the limit, both mentally and physically, in pursuit of their goal to make the world a better place. &lt;i&gt;Marathon Quest&lt;/i&gt; is an inspiring and engaging read for anyone interested in running, travel or philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
