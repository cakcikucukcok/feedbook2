  <title>What is Property? - Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If the law has been able to render the right of heredity common to all the children of one father, can it not render it equal for all his grandchildren and great-grandchildren? If the law no longer heeds the age of any member of the family, can it not, by the right of heredity, cease to heed it in the race, in the tribe, in the nation? Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved between citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers? In a word, can the principle of succession become a principle of equality?&lt;br /&gt;
To sum up all these ideas in one inclusive question: What is the principle of heredity? What are the foundations of inequality? What is property?" />
