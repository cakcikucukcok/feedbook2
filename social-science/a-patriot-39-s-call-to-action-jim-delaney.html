  <title>A Patriot&#39;s Call to Action - Jim Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Patriots Call to Action will enable busy Americans to more easily square todays unending political palaver and double-talk with our Constitutions original intent. 
In bite-sized form, this eminently readable book clearly summarizes some key constitutional concepts, like the Supremacy Clause, the Welfare Clause, Nullification, Executive Orders, Impeachment, Secession, etc.,  which will enable the reader to distinguish between politically correct, agenda-driven interpretations of the Constitution and what our Founders actually intended.  
Given the complacency gripping the country and the political ruling classs brazen circumvention of foundational Constitutional restraints, the author fearlessly and unambiguously reminds us of our God-given rights, authority and responsibilities as citizens of a republic, and outlines a commonsense action plan for restoring constitutional order.
The author posits that too many Americans are conditioned to the benefits of collectivism and the seductive, yet empty, promises of a suffocatingly expansive central government. Uninformed and seduced by the razzle-dazzle of self-serving political elites, many Americans have carelessly permitted our government to lead us on the path toward economic ruin and political oppressiondevelopments which would have dumbfounded and enraged our Founding Fathers.
The author unflinchingly asserts that to believe we are a republic today is foolhardy at best, delusional at worst. Absent bold grassroots remedies, the author asserts that our wealth, our way of life, our liberties will surely go the way of the dinosaurs.
If youre looking for simple-minded validation of your political party affiliation, this book isnt for you. Some of what the author says will rankle, but it will make you think and, hopefully, will encourage you to take action to restore and safeguard those principles and practices which made America historys most productive experiment in self-government." />
