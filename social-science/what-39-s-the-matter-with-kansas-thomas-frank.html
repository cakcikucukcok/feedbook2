  <title>What&#39;s the Matter with Kansas? - Thomas Frank</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &quot;our most insightful social observers&quot;* cracks the great political mystery of our time: how conservatism, once a marker of class privilege, became the creed of millions of ordinary Americans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With his acclaimed wit and acuity, Thomas Frank turns his eye on what he calls the &quot;thirty-year backlash&quot;--the populist revolt against a supposedly liberal establishment. The high point of that backlash is the Republican Party&#39;s success in building the most unnatural of alliances: between blue-collar Midwesterners and Wall Street business interests, workers and bosses, populists and right-wingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In asking &quot;what &#39;s the matter with Kansas?&quot;--how a place famous for its radicalism became one of the most conservative states in the union--Frank, a native Kansan and onetime Republican, seeks to answer some broader American riddles: Why do so many of us vote against our economic interests? Where&#39;s the outrage at corporate manipulators? And whatever happened to middle-American progressivism? The questions are urgent as well as provocative. Frank answers them by examining pop conservatism--the bestsellers, the radio talk shows, the vicious political combat--and showing how our long culture wars have left us with an electorate far more concerned with their leaders&#39; &quot;values&quot; and down-home qualities than with their stands on hard questions of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brilliant analysis--and funny to boot--&lt;i&gt;What&#39;s the Matter with Kansas?&lt;/i&gt; presents a critical assessment of who we are, while telling a remarkable story of how a group of frat boys, lawyers, and CEOs came to convince a nation that they spoke on behalf of the People.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;                 *&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
