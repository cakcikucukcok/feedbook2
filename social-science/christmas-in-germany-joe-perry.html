  <title>Christmas in Germany - Joe Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For poets, priests, and politicians--and especially ordinary Germans--in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the image of the loving nuclear family gathered around the Christmas tree symbolized the unity of the nation at large. German Christmas was supposedly organic, a product of the winter solstice rituals of pagan &quot;Teutonic&quot; tribes, the celebration of the birth of Jesus, and the age-old customs that defined German character. Yet, as Joe Perry argues, Germans also used these annual celebrations to contest the deepest values that held the German community together: faith, family, and love, certainly, but also civic responsibility, material prosperity, and national belonging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This richly illustrated volume explores the invention, evolution, and politicization of Germany&#39;s favorite national holiday. According to Perry, Christmas played a crucial role in public politics, as revealed in the militarization of &quot;War Christmas&quot; during World War I and World War II, the Nazification of Christmas by the Third Reich, and the political manipulation of Christmas during the Cold War. Perry offers a close analysis of the impact of consumer culture on popular celebration and the conflicts created as religious, commercial, and political authorities sought to control the holiday&#39;s meaning. By unpacking the intimate links between domestic celebration, popular piety, consumer desires, and political ideology, Perry concludes that family festivity was central in the making and remaking of public national identities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
