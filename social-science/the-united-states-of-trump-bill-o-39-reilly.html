  <title>The United States of Trump - Bill O&#39;Reilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A rare, insider&#39;s look at the life of Donald Trump from Bill O&#39;Reilly, the bestselling author of the &lt;i&gt;Killing &lt;/i&gt;series, based on exclusive interview material and deep research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers around the world have been enthralled by journalist and &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Bill O&#39;Reilly&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Killing &lt;/i&gt;series--riveting works of nonfiction that explore the most famous events in history. Now&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; O&#39;Reilly turns his razor-sharp observations to his most compelling subject thus far--President Donald J. Trump. In this thrilling narrative, O&#39;Reilly blends primary, never-before-released interview material with a history that recounts Trump&#39;s childhood and family and the factors from his life and career that forged the worldview that the president of the United States has taken to the White House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a partisan pro-Trump or anti-Trump book, this is an up-to-the-minute, intimate view of the man and his sphere of influence--of &quot;how Donald Trump&#39;s view of America was formed, and how it has changed since becoming the most powerful person in the world&quot;-- from a writer who has known the president for thirty years. This is an unprecedented, gripping account of the life of a sitting president as he makes history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the author will tell you, &quot;If you want some insight into the most unlikely political phenomenon of our lifetimes, you&#39;ll get it here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
