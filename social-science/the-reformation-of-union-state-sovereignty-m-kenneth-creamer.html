  <title>The Reformation of Union State Sovereignty - M. Kenneth Creamer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Are you unhappy about the intrusiveness of the federal government into you private and personal business? Are you interested in insulating your private and personal life from such intrusion? Then you need to understand the proper role your Union State is suppose to play in the structure of your Constitutional Republic, how that role has been subverted, and what can be done to get that essential role restored.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Recently, there has been much talk about Liberty and State Sovereignty and the losses thereof. However, while it is encouraging to have these talking points make their way to the forefront of the main-stream, talk alone will accomplish nothing. The Reformation of Union State Sovereignty is an arsenal of well researched and well cited legal principals, as well as specific actions that can be taken in the battle to re-establish the Sovereignty of the Union States, and ultimately restore the cherished Liberties of We The People.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It can never be too often repeated that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest, and ourselves united. From the conclusion of this [the Revolutionary] war we shall be going downhill. It will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the People for support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war will remain on us long, will be made heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion. -Thomas Jefferson on the drafting of the Virginia State Constitution&lt;/P&gt;" />
