  <title>The Political Injustice Affecting Our Schools, Teachers and Students - Dr. G.V. Hair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do politicians always claim our teachers and our educational system is failing our students?  Of course they claim an American student is lagging behind the rest of the worlds students, but is this really the truth or do politicians have other societal and political reasons that need to be looked at?   The lack of support our federal and state politicians give to our teachers and our American educational system is embarrassing.  For the last 25 years politicians have used selective statistics and fear tactics to manipulate the public into believing our teachers and our American educational system has denied our students a solid education.   American Teachers and the American School System Did Not Fail Our Students, is the first book to address the idea that our teachers and our American educational system were used as a political scapegoat to advance political careers and to promote a standardized form of society.  
The book will be composed of an introduction with eight chapters.  The introduction will describe the reasons for writing a book to support teachers and American educational system.  The eight chapters that follow will describe different  aspects of the educational environment and how they have been influenced by the standardized movement." />
