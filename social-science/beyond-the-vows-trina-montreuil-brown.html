  <title>Beyond the Vows - Trina  Montreuil Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What happens when you finally marry the man you fell head over heels with and soon discover that he has been unfaithful not once, but twice and still striving to overcome! After experiencing such devastation, you are soon bombarded with questions like, Is my fairy-tale wedding over? Did I not hear the voice of God clearly? Did I use this method of marriage as a defense to comfort my fears and doubts, or did I marry the wrong man? For surely, the man whom I love and who loves me will never bring harm to me.
Every marriage is unique and designed with a specific purpose and plan. Despite religion, race, or creed, marriages can sometimes be uncertain. Where there are couples that enter into this union strictly for love, others may come together under different circumstances. And when you are genuinely in love, despite any offense, you cannot just turn the switch on and off because love is everlasting. With this element, both individuals can conquer the world, even the sin of adultery! With the brutal pains and agony of adultery, everyone has a breaking point! Oh, how I wished I could have turned back the hands of time. Had I known how destructive this spirit was, I could have planned and prepared for it, but one can never predict life to be sweet without the bitterness of war. But it wasnt until I married my husband that I found that he was not my enemy, and this spirit was indeed an intruder. Did I run and hide? No! I pulled up my sleeves like an old-fashioned woman would and joined him in this battle. From start to finish, we have invested in this marriage and built this relationship on a sacred foundation. Why would I just hand my marriage over? The modern womans evolution is to pack her belongings and dont look back. She is strong and independent, but I am that kind of woman who has embraced the stamina to stay and who is willing to go beyond the vows." />
