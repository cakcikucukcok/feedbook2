  <title>The Barefoot Lawyer - Chen Guangcheng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An electrifying memoir by the blind Chinese activist who inspired millions with the story of his fight for justice and his belief in the cause of freedom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like a scene out of a thriller: one morning in April 2012, China&#39;s most famous political activist--a blind, self-taught lawyer--climbed over the wall of his heavily guarded home and escaped. Days later, he turned up at the American embassy in Beijing, and only a furious round of high-level negotiations made it possible for him to leave China and begin a new life in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen Guangcheng is a unique figure on the world stage, but his story is even more remarkable than anyone knew. The son of a poor farmer in rural China, blinded by illness when he was an infant, Chen was fortunate to survive a difficult childhood. But despite his disability, he was determined to educate himself and fight for the rights of his country&#39;s poor, especially a legion of women who had endured forced sterilizations and abortions under the hated &quot;one child&quot; policy. Repeatedly harassed, beaten, and imprisoned by Chinese authorities, Chen was ultimately placed under house arrest. After nearly two years of increasing danger, he evaded his captors and fled to freedom.&lt;br&gt;Both a riveting memoir and a revealing portrait of modern China, &lt;i&gt;The Barefoot Lawyer&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a man who has never accepted limits and always believed in the power of the human spirit to overcome any obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
