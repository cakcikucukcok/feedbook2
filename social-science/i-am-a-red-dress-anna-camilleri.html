  <title>I Am a Red Dress - Anna Camilleri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman in a red dress conjures particular images, emotions and stereotypes. Eroticism. Lust. Passion. With &lt;i&gt;I Am a Red Dress&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed writer and performer Anna Camilleri confronts these images and stereotypes in essays, stories, and poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the political with the intensely personal, Camilleri&amp;rsquo;s intimate writings are premised on a search for selfhood&amp;mdash;strong, queer, female&amp;mdash;within and outside of her bonds to other women in her family. She says, &amp;ldquo;My work is motivated by a deep desire to understand, and in the words of Dorothy Allison, to &amp;lsquo;remake the world.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the perception that we live in a progressive society, Camilleri is not convinced that we live in a world that is necessarily better for women, indigenous people and people of color, queer people, or the poor and the working class. But she recognizes that the imagination is a powerful force that can lead to better lives, and a better world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Am A Red Dress&lt;/i&gt; is Camilleri conjuring her imagination, as she seeks to find her rightful place in the world. Like a flashing red light, this collection of stories and essays signal a changing of consciousness. It&amp;rsquo;s also Camilleri attempting to unravel memory, a trace that is inextricably tied to her culture and class, and the imaginations of women in her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her voice is the sound the status quo makes as it crashes to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anna Camilleri&lt;/b&gt; is a Toronto-based writer and performance poet. She was co-editor of &lt;i&gt;Brazen Femme&lt;/i&gt;, shortlisted for a Lambda Award, and co-founded Taste This, with whom she collaborated to publish &lt;i&gt;Boys Like Her&lt;/i&gt;, winner of a ForeWord Magazine Literary Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
