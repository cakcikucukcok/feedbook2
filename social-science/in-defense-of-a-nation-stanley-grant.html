  <title>In Defense of a Nation - Stanley Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;American Christians and patriots know that a battle is brewing. It is a battle for the heart and soul of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cold war being waged against Americas sovereignty, exceptionalism, Christian heritage, and rule of law is rooted in spiritual hatred for our being a nation in covenant with Almighty God. Accelerated by the rise of Barack Obama, and Congress&#39; failure to restrain his overreach, citizen outrage has reached an all-time high. The lines between tyranny and liberty are being defined, and enemies (both foreign and domestic) are hard at work to destroy even the foundations. This is the final push, and the cold war will go hot.  War is coming to America, and it&#39;s coming soon to a street corner near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the American church snoozes, and contents itself with pretty buildings, feel-good sermons, Jesus tattoos, hip songs, light shows and big drums, elaborate productions, potlucks, and abandonment theology. The pulpits...the firebrands of the revolution in the 1700&#39;s...have gone silent on issues pertaining to liberty and tyranny, God and Country. A wake-up call is fast approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using scripture and current events, In Defense of a Nation frames the final showdown for America in a way that will cause you to lose sleep. It examines such questions as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Is America a lucky anomaly in human history, or is it a deliberate act of God?&lt;br /&gt;
 Who is America in the Bible?&lt;br /&gt;
 What will the inevitable clash between Islam and Communism vs. America and the Jewish State of Israel look like?&lt;br /&gt;
 When will it occur?&lt;br /&gt;
 What is the beast system of the Bible, and who is the son of perdition?&lt;br /&gt;
 Who is the community organizer in Scripture that carried the anti-Christ messages of social justice and redistribution of wealth?&lt;br /&gt;
 How are the politics of Judas being deployed against America today, and when will his final kiss of betrayal come?&lt;br /&gt;
 Who is the real Barack Obama, why him, why now?&lt;br /&gt;
 What does the end-game look like for America?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be on the cutting edge of events as they unfold, then In Defense Of A Nation is a must-read. America is beyond the tipping point, and quickly approaching the flash point...which will comewhether you like it or notwhether youre ready or not. You will not be allowed to sit this out. The good news is the complete destruction of the corrupt political establishment within America, followed by a spiritual awakening in we the people, concluding with liberty for our land and citizens once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America&#39;s toughest days are just ahead. But so is our crowning moment in history. And you have come to the Kingdom for such a time as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, make it count.&lt;/p&gt;" />
