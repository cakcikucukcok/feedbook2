  <title>Second Treatise of Government - John Locke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="English Enlightenment philosopher John Locke has been called the “Father of Liberalism”. Following in the tradition of Sir Francis Bacon, he is one of the first British empiricists, which emphasizes the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas. His work would greatly influence other prominent political and literary figures including Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and the founding fathers of the United States of America. Contained here in this volume is one of his most influential writings, the “Second Treatise of Government”. The “Second Treatise” is concerned with five specific themes in relation to government. Firstly Locke defines a state of nature in which people have perfect freedom in dealing with the affairs of their own person and property. Secondly he discusses conquest and slavery arguing that the conquest and enslavement of absolute monarchy is a violation of natural law. Thirdly he asserts that civil society exists to protect a fundamental right to property by which he means life, liberty, and estate. Fourthly he discusses his views on representative government which may take any form so long as it is representative in upholding the fundamental rights prescribed by natural law. Lastly he discusses the right to revolt against any government that denies the aforementioned rights. The arguments made in Locke’s “Second Treatise” greatly influenced both the American and French revolutions leading to the foundation of modern democracy." />
