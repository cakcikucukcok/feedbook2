  <title>Danger and Poetry: One Glider Pilot&#39;s First Hundred Hours, from Flight School to Rescue Mission - Joe Karam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joe Karam was born to transcend, but perhaps not to fly. When at twenty-seven his quest for freedom led him to set foot in a glider for the first time, he was overcome with fear and desire. Nothing seemed to have prepared him for such a formidable test of courage, nor did he know anything about Charlie, the taciturn flight instructor he had just entrusted with his life. And yet the sky kept calling... A didactic memoir and a passionate love letter to aviation, &lt;em&gt;Danger and Poetry&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;unites heart and mind to celebrate the pursuit of dreams and the power of teachers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Particularly recommended for:&lt;br /&gt; - Individuals curious to learn about the joys and challenges of gliding and soaring in a sailplane&lt;br /&gt; - Prospective or existing aviators interested in the mental aspects of the pilot training journey&lt;br /&gt; - Novice or student pilots eager to compare notes on flight training basics and early milestones&lt;br /&gt; - Airplane pilots aspiring to upgrade to more affordable and more silent aerial experiences&lt;br /&gt; - Young freedom lovers, who in many countries can legally fly solo in a glider at age 14&lt;br /&gt; - Flight instructors (especially CFI-G) seeking relevant reading material for their students&lt;br /&gt; - Fixed-base operators (FBO) looking to stock, display, and retail enticing products&lt;/p&gt;" />
