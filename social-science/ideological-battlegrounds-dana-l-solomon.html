  <title>Ideological Battlegrounds - Dana L. Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;Can entertainment challenge divisive ideologies? Can we use theatre, film, games, novels, and other stories to disarm the ideologies of fear that contribute to discrimination, violent conflict, human rights abuses, mass atrocities, and genocide? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book introduces and develops Ideologically Challenging Entertainment (ICE) as entertainment that challenges &amp;ldquo;us vs. them&amp;rdquo; narratives associated with radicalization and violent conflict. ICE presents multiple perspectives on a conflict through absorbing, entertaining narratives, countering polarizing, fear-inspired perspectives with the acceptance &amp;ndash; even the embrace &amp;ndash; of multiple viewpoints and worldviews without losing sight of facts and evidence. Based on evidence from multiple disciplines such as history, sociology, theatre, and political science, ICE presents an approach to entertainment that can begin to close the ideological divide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than presenting a theory, this book also explores the first ICE production, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Two Merchants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an adaptation of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Merchant of Venice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; modified to challenge ideologies of the Arab-Israeli Conflict. A mixed-methods study of audience responses showed that many audience members reconsidered their ideological views, not only about the Arab-Israeli conflict, but about ideological divisions that were more relevant to them personally. The book includes quotes from audience members talking about how the show inspired them to learn to accept people from different backgrounds, recognize and change their own prejudices, and learn more about the facts contributing to conflict. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book is unique, both in its conceptualization of entertainment as a means to address both local and global conflicts, and in its provision of evidence for the power of performance as a tool for confronting, and influencing, ideological change. Unlike other approaches, ICE integrates into popular, mainstream entertainment, in fact, requiring that productions are those that audiences enjoy. Moreover, it demonstrates that such productions can have the desired impact on audiences, without inflaming existing tensions and prejudices. Creating ethical entertainment that challenges polarizing ideologies offers a new approach to bridging dangerous ideological chasms that, without significant intervention, will only continue to worsen.&lt;/span&gt;" />
