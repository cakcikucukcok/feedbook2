  <title>Notes from the Dockside - Mike Yurk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These stores are mainly about fishing, There are five parts to any fishing trip. There is the water we are fishing, the baits and equipment we use, the fish we are or are not catching, the people we are with and the weather. These stores try to have all those in them. 
These stories are about the fun and adventure of fishing, appreciating the waters, shores and the birds and animals we see when we are on the water. But most importantly it is family and friends we fish with. In these stories you will meet the Boat Doctor, the Commissioner of Fishing, the Worm Dude and Mikes beloved Bass Queen and the many other fishermen and characters who make these fishing trips and stories so memorable." />
