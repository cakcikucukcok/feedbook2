  <title>A Season in the Sun - Randy Roberts, Johnny Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The story of Mickey Mantle&#39;s magnificent 1956 season&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mickey Mantle was the ideal batter for the atomic age, capable of hitting a baseball harder and farther than any other player in history. He was also the perfect idol for postwar America, a wholesome hero from the heartland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Season in the Sun&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed historians Randy Roberts and Johnny Smith recount the defining moment of Mantle&#39;s legendary career: 1956, when he overcame a host of injuries and critics to become the most celebrated athlete of his time. Taking us from the action on the diamond to Mantle&#39;s off-the-field exploits, Roberts and Smith depict Mantle not as an ideal role model or a bitter alcoholic, but a complex man whose faults were smoothed over by sportswriters eager to keep the truth about sports heroes at bay. An incisive portrait of an American icon, &lt;i&gt;A Season in the Sun&lt;/i&gt; is an essential work for baseball fans and anyone interested in the 1950s." />
