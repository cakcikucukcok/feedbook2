  <title>FIT - Rikki Beadle-Blair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FIT is a bold and groundbreaking new play for young people written and directed by acclaimed writer/director Rikki Beadle-Blair. The play was developed to address the growing problem of homophobic bullying in Britain&#39;s schools and was especially created for Key Stage 3 (KS3) students (Year 7-9), specifically complementing various learning objectives from the National Curriculum, particularly PHSE and Citizenship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FIT is about attempting to FIT in and trying to stand out in a culture where everything from not liking sport to wearing the wrong trainers is &#39;gay&#39;. Snappy dialogue and pacy writing combine with energetic hip-hop dance, original music and sparky comedy to make FIT an unforgettable piece of theatre. FIT enjoyed a hugely successful run during 2007 and 2008, where 20,000 young people in over 75 schools across the UK saw the play, accompanied by a workshop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FIT has also been made into a short film which has toured UK Schools and will continue to tour nationwide throughout 2010 as part of the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. The production of FIT was supported by UK Gay rights organisation Stonewall.&lt;/p&gt;" />
