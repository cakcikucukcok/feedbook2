  <title>Fool Me Once - Rick Lax</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rick Lax was paranoid to begin with. He saw lies everywhere. And when he saw them, he spoke up. But when his girlfriend gets conned by a violent drug dealer, nothing Rick does seems to help. So what if he misses the next lie? What if spotting them isn&#39;t enough to protect against them? What if exposing lies puts him in even more danger?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrified of being conned himself, Rick bolts for Vegas, deception capital of the world, to learn the game and how to guard against it. Rick meets deceivers of all kinds, from back-alley hustlers and poker pros to the biggest headliners on the Strip. During the course of his unconventional education, which includes passing himself off as an octogenarian, being exposed as a card counter, and picking up a hooker (inadvertently, of course), Rick gets closer to becoming a human lie detector...but at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of &lt;i&gt;Fool Me Once&lt;/i&gt;, you&#39;ll know why seventh graders make better liars than college students, how to use a handful of rice as a polygraph, and how to bluff a poker pro. But above all, you&#39;ll understand why some things in life are a lot worse than being fooled.&lt;/p&gt;" />
