  <title>Derek Jarman - Moving Pictures of a Painter: Home Movies, Super 8 Films and Other Small Gestures - Martin Frey, Michael Wetzel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The English painter, film-maker and writer Derek Jarman (1942&amp;ndash;1994) is mainly known&lt;br /&gt; for his work in the medium of film, but he always saw himself primarily as a painter.&lt;br /&gt; In this study of his lesser known home movies, Super 8 films and the &amp;lsquo;cinema of small&lt;br /&gt; gestures&amp;rsquo; that Jarman developed out of them, Martin Frey discusses numerous Super 8&lt;br /&gt; films as well as the films THE LAST OF ENGLAND, IN THE SHADOW OF THE SUN and&lt;br /&gt; THE ANGELIC CONVERSATION. He examines Jarman&amp;rsquo;s filming techniques and way of&lt;br /&gt; working and also analyses influences from the fields of painting and literature, such as&lt;br /&gt; Allen Ginsberg, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Yves Klein.&lt;br /&gt; For Jarman, life and work represented an indivisible unity. Numerous autobiographical&lt;br /&gt; elements from his works are thus considered in this volume: his repressed childhood and&lt;br /&gt; adolescence in post-war England, his coming out and the liberated life of the seventies,&lt;br /&gt; his struggle against the unequal treatment of homosexuals during the Thatcher era, his&lt;br /&gt; dealing with his own HIV infection and finally his personal commitment to fighting&lt;br /&gt; discrimination against people who are HIV-positive or who have already developed Aids.&lt;br /&gt; http://www.derek-jarman.info/&lt;/p&gt;" />
