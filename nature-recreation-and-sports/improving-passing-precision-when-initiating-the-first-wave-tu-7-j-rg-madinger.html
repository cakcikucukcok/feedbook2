  <title>Improving passing precision when initiating the first wave (TU 7) - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The objective of this training unit is to improve running paths, passing and the decision-making process during the first wave. After a warm-up running exercise, the subsequent short game already includes quick adjustment exercises and long passes. During the ball familiarization phase and the goalkeeper warm-up shooting, the players practice playing long passes before they combine several actions with first wave initiation in a series of shots. The closing small group exercises finally focus on making passing decisions.
The training unit consists of the following key exercises:
- Warm-up/Stretching (individual exercise: 10 minutes/total time: 10 minutes)
- Short game (15/25)
- Ball familiarization (10/35)
- Goalkeeper warm-up shooting (10/45)
- Offense/Series of shots (15/60)
- Offense/Small groups (15/75)
- Offense/Small groups (15/90)
Training unit total time: 90 minutes
Difficulty: Medium level (youth teams under 15 years of age and adult teams)" />
