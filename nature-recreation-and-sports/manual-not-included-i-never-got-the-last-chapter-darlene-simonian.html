  <title>“Manual Not Included: I Never Got the Last Chapter.” - Darlene Simonian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although most major cancers are occurring less frequently, some are on the rise and require greater efforts at control, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, cancers of the liver, pancreas, kidney, thyroid, and esophagus in men and women, testicular cancer in men, melanoma, and cancers of the brain and bladder in women and childhood cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. 
These same cancers can also be found in animals. Multiple myeloma for instance is a rare neoplasm found in certain animals, including cats. This rare form of cancer ravaged our beloved and loyal cat. Manual not Included: I Never Got the Last Chapter is the first book to document the true life story of a familys pet cat, who was afflicted with this type of cancer. Its not unusual to assume a family pet will be around for years and then quietly pass away from old age. The ideal situation would be to just pass away peacefully while they sleep. Unfortunately, it doesnt happen that way. 
Life goes along as usualfeeding them, playing with them, loving them, and watching them grow. Then one day they get sick, and the doctor mentions the word no one wants to hear, Cancer! 
Every year, new cases of multiple myeloma will present itself at a veterinary office with little or no information provided to the owner. This book will allow pet owners worldwide to understand what multiple myeloma is and how to treat it if their cat receives this diagnosis. Although this book depicts the life story of a cat, the disease is not species specific. 
Readers will find pictures depicting Dopey and his familys life over the last fifteen years. The many visuals in this book will help readers of all ages to bond with this fun and loving cat. The pictures of him will allow readers to feel his story and connect with him personally." />
