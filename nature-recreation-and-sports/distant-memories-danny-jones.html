  <title>Distant Memories - Danny Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 26 men featured in this book have one thing in common: They were all great football players. These legends were the superstars of the NFL and AFL during the glorious 60s and the fun-loving 70s. However, only 2 of these legends are in the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. These stars revolutionized the game of Pro Football with their brilliant performances and were Pro Footballs biggest gate attractions. As the years go by, and the 60s and 70s have become a distant memory, these outstanding football players and mavericks have been unappreciated and forgotten. These heroes and legends of the fall contributed to the success of the NFL and made Pro Football the most popular and exciting sport in America. Distant Memories- The NFLs Best Ever Players of the 60s and 70s focuses on Pro Footballs forgotten stars and legendary heroes from the glorious past. Its about pioneers and great players from yesteryear. 
I have always wanted to write a book like this. Since I was a former amateur football player and have the knowledge and resources about football, I thought I would be the right person to write this book and do it with class and style. I have watched every football player in this book play every week and have seen all of the weekly highlight shows. I have followed their entire careers and I have seen every touchdown they scored. I watched all NFL and AFL games on TV in the 60s and 70s. In 1970, when the AFL and NFL merged to become one league, I watched every game on TV during the 70s.I can remember my golden Sunday mornings and early afternoons when I played football during the 70s. I always hurried home from my games so I could watch the NFL on TV. You can ask my wonderful mother. She knew where I was every Sunday afternoon during the football season when I was young. I would like the players in this book to finally receive the recognition they deserve for their outstanding accomplishments.
