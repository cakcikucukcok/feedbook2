  <title>Modelling Railway Scenery Volume 2 - Anthony A Reeves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether you are just about to embark on your scenic modelling journey, or want to re-work an existing layout, this clearly written volume will be invaluable. The author guides you through the process of collecting field-trip information, both written and photographic, and then demonstrates, using step-by-step instructions, how the colours, textures and features depicted in the reference photographs can be replicated to create a wonderful model landscape. The author describes in detail the modelling techniques he employs to create long and short grass, crop, fallow and freshly ploughed fields, trimmed hedges, mature hedgerows, hedgerow trees, broadland trees in summer, Scots pine trees, silver birch, autumn and winter trees, as well as dead and fallen trees and trees in half relief. Finally, he brings together all the features that have been covered in the book and describes the building of a scale model representation of the field trip photographs in the form of a 3 x 2 ft diorama. Aimed at all those railway modellers who wish to create attractive, realistic scenery for their layouts, brimming with advice and tips and with over four hundred inspirational reference colour images and colour instructional photographs. A sister volume to Modelling Railway Scenery Volume 1 - Cuttings, Hills, Mountains, Streams and Lakes (Crowood 2013)." />
