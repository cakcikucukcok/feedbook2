  <title>Echoes - Nick Bullock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;As I sat cradling the man&amp;#8217;s head, with his blood and brains sticking to my hands, I heard a voice &amp;#150; my own voice. It was asking me something. Asking how I had ended up like this, desperate and lost among people who thought nothing of caving in a man&amp;#8217;s head and then standing back to watch him die.&amp;#8221;  Nick Bullock was a prison officer working in a maximum-security jail with some of Britain&amp;#8217;s most notorious criminals. Trapped in a world of aggression and fear, he felt frustrated and alone. Then he discovered the mountains.  Making up for lost time, Bullock soon became one of Britain&amp;#8217;s best climbers, learning his trade in the mountains of Scotland and Wales, and travelling from Pakistan to Peru in his search for new routes and a new way of seeing the world &amp;#150; and ultimately an escape route from his life inside.   Told that no one ever leaves the service &amp;#150; the security, the stability, the &amp;#145;job for life&amp;#8217; &amp;#150; Bullock focused his existence on a single goal: to walk free, with no shackles, into a mountain life.   Echoes, his first book, is a powerful and compelling exploration of freedom &amp;#150; and what it means to live life on your own terms.&lt;/div&gt;" />
