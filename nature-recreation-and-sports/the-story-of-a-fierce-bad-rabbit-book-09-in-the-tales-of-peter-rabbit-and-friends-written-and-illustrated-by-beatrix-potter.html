  <title>THE STORY OF A FIERCE, BAD RABBIT - Book 09 in the Tales of Peter Rabbit and friends - Written and Illustrated By Beatrix Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Tale of a Fierce Bad Rabbit tells of a bad rabbit which finds a good rabbit sitting on a bench eating a carrot his mother gave him. Wanting the carrot, he takes it from the good rabbit and scratches him to get it. The good rabbit escapes and hides in a nearby hole. Meanwhile, a hunter notices the bad rabbit sitting on the bench and mistakes him for a bird. He fires at the bad rabbit, but on arrival at the spot finds nothing but a carrot and a rabbit tail on the bench. A little while later, the good rabbit sees the bad rabbit running away without his whiskers and tail!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book was written for Louie Warne, the daughter of Potter&amp;#39;s publisher, Harold Warne and was intended for babies and very young children, seemingly to teach a moral.&lt;br /&gt;
