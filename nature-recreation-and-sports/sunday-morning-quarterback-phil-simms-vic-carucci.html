  <title>Sunday Morning Quarterback - Phil Simms, Vic Carucci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An in-depth and surprising look at the game, &lt;em&gt;Sunday Morning Quarterback&lt;/em&gt; will dramatically change the way you watch football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve heard all the football clich&amp;#233;s: &quot;Their offense is too predictable,&quot; or &quot;They&#39;ve got to win the turnover battle,&quot; or &quot;They didn&#39;t make any halftime adjustments.&quot; Perhaps you&#39;ve heard them so often that you&#39;ve come to see them as obvious truths. Phil Simms, after an illustrious career as a Super Bowl&amp;#8211;winning quarterback and a broadcaster, is here to tell you that these -- and many other blanket statements taken as gospel -- are all myths, and whoever says them has no idea of what they&#39;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drilling deep into the core of football, Simms also shows the hidden signs that players look for that can determine the outcome of a game. Whether it&#39;s discovering how a linebacker positions his feet before he blitzes or how to react if the safety is eight or nine yards from the line of scrimmage, knowing these &quot;dirty little secrets&quot; gives players and their coaches a tremendous advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Simms shares his insights into the enormous challenges coaches face in today&#39;s game, evaluating the top coaches and what makes them successful. He takes a look at some of the greatest players he&#39;s played with and against, and what he misses most about the game -- waking up Monday mornings feeling beat up and sore. He looks at the next generation of football players -- his son, Tampa Bay&#39;s Chris Simms, among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Simms shares stories from his playing days with Bill Parcells and the New York Giants, and the inside access he&#39;s had as an announcer for one of the top NFL broadcasting teams in football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun and lively, &lt;em&gt;Sunday Morning Quarterback&lt;/em&gt; should be required reading for anyone who loves football.&lt;/p&gt;" />
