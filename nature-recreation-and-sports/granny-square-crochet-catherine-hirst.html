  <title>Granny Square Crochet - Catherine Hirst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Make over 35 fabulous projects, from quick and easy scarves to mug cosies. The granny square is the starting point for many people when they first learn to crochet, but as their skills progress, this versatile crochet block is often forgotten. In Granny Square Crochet , crochet teacher Catherine Hirst presents 35 projects which show how this traditional square can be updated and used in many different ways. The first chapter has over a dozen projects for the home, ranging from a blue-and-white mug cosy which can be made in less than an hour, to a stunning bed cover. There are cushions and seat covers to brighten up your living room, plus place mats, drinks coasters and a runner for your table. The second chapter has some great accessories, including gloves, scarves and bags, and even a dog coat to keep your favourite hound warm in winter. The third chapter has a great range of patterns to make as gifts for children and babies, such as crib and pram blankets, bibs, hats and toys. Each project is graded according to the level of skill required, and there is a comprehensive basic techniques chapter explaining all you need to know. Catherine Hirst was taught crochet at a young age by her grandmother and took to it immediately - she quickly learned to knit and embroider as well, and has been hand-making clothing, accessories, and gifts ever since. Her first book, Teeny Tiny Crochet , is also published by CICO Books." />
