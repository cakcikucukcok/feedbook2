  <title>Why You Should Listen When Your Animals Don&#39;t - Diana DelMonte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How do our animals feel when we are not honest with ourselves or are not mindful of our thoughts? How do they react to our conflicts or unresolved issues? Why do they sometimes leave home? Diana DelMonte presents our animal friends as clever, complex beings capable of deep emotions and wisdom. We find an opportunity to learn about ourselves through the behaviors of our generous, kindhearted companions such as Dali, the dog who tore the house apart until his person learned to handle her own anxious, addictive behaviors. Diana welcomes us to the world of animal communication, gives us five steps to listen to animals, and teaches us how to develop our awareness skills. This book, filled with true stories, spiritual direction, and science, is designed to deepen your intuition and will radically alter your bond with animals. It is a classic guide for anyone wishing to forge a spiritual connection with the majesty and mystery of the animal world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diana DelMonte has written a marvel of a book! Every page is a story of compassion. &lt;br /&gt;
Read this and be amazed and touched. &lt;br /&gt;
Phil Thompson, Bodhi Tree Bookstore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diana opens windows to new ways of seeing our deepest interconnectedness with all animals and all that is. &lt;br /&gt;
Allen M. Schoen, DVM, MS, PhD, and author of Kindred Spirits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this beautifully written book, Diana Del Monte has created a must-read for those who yearn to receive the heart-to-heart messages our animal friends communicate to us for our own inner healing. &lt;br /&gt;
