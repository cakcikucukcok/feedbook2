  <title>The Journey Home - Ladee Basset</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;EM&gt;The Journey Home&lt;/EM&gt; is a collection of 100 poems written in the traditional poetic form of rhyme and time. Many of the poems are based upontruelife experiences, expressions of desperation and struggle, heartache and heart break, in the remembrance or thinking of either someone or a beloved pet, some are as aresult of an personal existing mood frame or purely based upon a factual point in time,some arepolitical view points or messages tothose involved inthe political systemand a few are entirely fictionalwrittensimplyfrom imagination. All of the combined poems are a journey through life, my life or our lives and the words are uniquely portrayed in perfect poetic context in rhyme and time creating a journey through life.. Each poem has a beginning, a middle and an ending whilst at the same time cleverly flows remaining on the subject matter without diversion. This book is the first book to express my minds abilities to write truely poetically and not merelyin prose, ode, or ballad form. Self contained structures all simple, easy to understand and read is the main aim whilst at the same time hopefully ensuring a message as concise as possible is given. These poems will be plondered upon undoubtedly and repetively for years to come by those who enjoy the love of poetry. The ability to both relate and correlate willbe experienced by thereader in not one of the poems but many of them. The undying devotion to create and express shines throughout this book from page to page and poem to poem." />
