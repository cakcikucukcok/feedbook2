  <title>Whatever Life Throws at You - Julie Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Loved this book! Great characters, great story, &amp; so much swooning!&quot; &lt;b&gt;-Cindi Madsen, USA Today bestselling author &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life loves a good curveball...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Annie Lucas&#39;s life is completely upended the moment her dad returns to the major leagues as the new pitching coach for the Kansas City Royals. Now she&#39;s living in Missouri (too cold), attending an all-girls school (no boys), and navigating the strange world of professional sports. But Annie has dreams of her own--most of which involve placing first at every track meet...and one starring the Royals&#39; super-hot rookie pitcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nineteen-year-old Jason Brody is completely, utterly, and totally off-limits. Besides, her dad would kill them both several times over. Not to mention Brody has something of a past, and his fan club is filled with C-cupped models, not smart-mouthed high school &quot;brats&quot; who can run the pants off every player on the team. Annie has enough on her plate without taking their friendship to the next level. The last thing she should be doing is falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But baseball isn&#39;t just a game. It&#39;s life. And sometimes, it can break your heart...&lt;/p&gt;" />
