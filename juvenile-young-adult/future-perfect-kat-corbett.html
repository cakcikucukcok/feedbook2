  <title>Future Perfect - Kat Corbett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tori Baylor, a serious dance student, has begun her final level at the school of Southern Ballet Theatre in Orlando, Florida. Her goal is to be accepted by the Company next year as a trainee, but she still has a problem with balance. She works desperately to overcome it, knowing its now or never for her. Her mother, whose job pays for her lessons, has crippling arthritis and will have to quit work after this year. As a trainee, Tori would get free classes and could continue to dance. Called upon one day to explain the future perfect tense to her sister, Roni, Tori ponders her destiny and wonders What is the future perfect of me?
	&lt;p&gt;When Roni brings home information about getting pen pals, both girls write off for one. Tori is excited to get a dance student at the school of the world-famous Maryinsky Theatre Ballet, formerly the Kirov, in St. Petersburg, Russia. She reads up on Russia and even learns some Russian words, hoping that she and Valentina, though far apart, will become real friends. I feel as if Im setting out on an adventure, she says, never dreaming how that adventure will change her life. &lt;p&gt;
