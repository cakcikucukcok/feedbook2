  <title>Adventures of Blue and Turkey - Nan Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Come and sit on the log. I have a story to tell you. 
There was a mischievous duck who grew up in the swamps of Louisiana area. This was very special duck. His name was Blue. 
The story goes like this: he turned blue when he swam in the cold pond one morning. 
His home was under the old wooden cabin. Blue loved to waddle over to the barn and listen to the sounds of the farm engines. His mother would often scold him. Youll get hurt over there, she would say. However, the smell of motor oil and the sounds of the noise of the engines would thrill him. He would sit by the hour watching people working on the engines. Blue knew when they made the right decisions to make the engines run better." />
