  <title>Keeping Holiday - Starr Meade, Justin Gerard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dylan loves his family&#39;s yearly vacation to Holiday and wishes it could last all year. When he finds a flyer asking if he&#39;d like to keep Holiday, he encounters a bigger and better Holiday than the one his family has always visited; he also learns that entering it requires the Founder&#39;s authorization. Thus begins Dylan&#39;s quest to meet the one of whom people keep saying: &quot;You can&#39;t find the Founder; he finds you./He&#39;s not just the Founder, he&#39;s the Finder too.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Dylan reads of Holiday&#39;s origins, he experiences a number of adventures and meets characters who represent the sights and sounds he always finds in Holiday-characters who explain how each of these familiarities points to the Founder&#39;s previous rescue of the city&#39;s inhabitants. And the more Dylan learns, the more he longs to personally know the one who holds the key to entering the &quot;real Holiday.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing for elementary-age children and older, author, teacher, and grandmother Starr Meade offers a book that families can read together, discovering along with Dylan how God brings a person to faith. &lt;em&gt;Keeping Holiday&lt;/em&gt; is also a charming, insightful way to help children grasp the meaning of the Incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
