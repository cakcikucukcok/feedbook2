  <title>The Mum Detective - Gwyneth Rees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A warm, funny, hugely appealing sequel to the very successful THE MUM HUNT. Esmie knows she wants to be a detective when she grows up - just like her dad. And now is the perfect time to start honing her investigative skills. First of all there&#39;s the mystery disappearance of Esmie&#39;s brother&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s mum (interestingly complicated!). Could she still be alive? Or does a vital clue lie beneath the soil of the local allotment? Even more importantly, Esmie is worried that her dad still hasn&#39;t proposed to his girlfriend, Lizzie. After all, Esmie went to enough trouble to act as match-maker for them! Then Esmie discovers that something very strange is going on - Lizzie is having a secret rendezvous with a mysterious man when she is supposed to be at work. What on earth is Lizzie&#39;s secret - and can Esmie find a way to make sure her new &#39;mum&#39; and dad stay together forever? Biographies Gwyneth Rees is half Welsh and half English and was brought up in Scotland. She went to Glasgow University and qualified as a doctor in 1990. She is a child and adolescent psychiatrist and has worked in several places, including Birmingham and London. She is the author of MERMAIDS, FAIRY DUST, FAIRY TREASURE, COSMO AND THE MAGIC SNEEZE - and, for older readers, MY MUM&#39;S FROM PLANET PLUTO and, of course, THE MUM HUNT." />
