  <title>Fame, Fate, and the First Kiss - Kasie West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fan favorite author Kasie West delivers an effervescent story about chasing your dreams and following your heart, perfect for fans of Jenny Han and Huntley Fitzpatrick. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacey Barnes has dreamed of being an actress for as long as she can remember. So when she gets the opportunity to star in a movie alongside one of Hollywood&amp;#8217;s hottest actors, she doesn&amp;#8217;t hesitate to accept the part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lacey quickly learns that life in the spotlight isn&amp;#8217;t as picture perfect as she imagined.&amp;#160;She&amp;#8217;s having trouble bonding with her costars, her father has hired the definition of a choir boy, Donavan Lake, to tutor her, and somewhere along the way she&amp;#8217;s lost her acting mojo. And just when it seems like things couldn&amp;#8217;t get any worse, it looks like someone on set is deliberately trying to sabotage her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Lacey&amp;#8217;s world spins out of control, it feels like the only person she can count on&amp;#8212;whether it&amp;#8217;s helping her try to unravel the mystery of who is out to get her or snap her out of her acting funk&amp;#8212;is Donavan. But what she doesn&amp;#8217;t count on is this straight-laced boy becoming another distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her entire future riding on this movie, Lacey knows she can&amp;#8217;t afford to get sidetracked by a crush. But for the first time in her life Lacey wonders if it&amp;#8217;s true that the best stories really do happen when you go off script.&lt;/p&gt;" />
