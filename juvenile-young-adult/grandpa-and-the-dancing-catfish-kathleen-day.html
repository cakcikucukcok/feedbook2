  <title>Grandpa and the Dancing Catfish - Kathleen Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There comes a day in a young childs life when the gift of childhoods magic begins to fade.
A new firm voice of reason says that the fantastical, the miraculous, are not real and the belief in them is foolish.  At that moment, the lights of the world dim,
there is a deep sadness in a childs heart that goes largely unnoticed...unless he is lucky enough to have a magical grandpa who knows that a childs way of seeing is the souls way of seeing.
Journey with a boy and his beloved grandpa to the banks of the beautiful Ipswich River as they undertake a mission to see if an old fishermans tale is true, if the catfish that live deep in the rivers still pools really do come out to dance by the light of the full moon. Join them as the grandfather gives to his grandson the gift his own grandfather gave to himkeeping the sacred treasure of the magical as he grows into the real world." />
