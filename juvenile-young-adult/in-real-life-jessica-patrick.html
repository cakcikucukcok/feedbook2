  <title>In Real Life - Jessica Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hannah Cho and Nick Cooper have been best friends since 8th grade. They   talk for hours on the phone, regularly shower each other with presents,   and know everything there is to know about one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s just one problem: Hannah and Nick have never actually met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah   has spent her entire life doing what she&#39;s supposed to, but when her   senior year spring break plans get ruined by a rule-breaker, she  decides  to break a rule or two herself. She impulsively decides to road  trip to  Vegas, her older sister and BFF in tow, to surprise Nick and  finally  declare her more-than-friend feelings for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah&#39;s  romantic  gesture backfires when she gets to Vegas and meets Nick&#39;s  girlfriend,  whom he failed to mention. And it turns out his  relationship status  isn&#39;t the only thing he&#39;s been lying to her about.  Hannah knows the real  Nick can&#39;t be that different from the online Nick  she knows and loves,  but now she only has one night in Sin City to  figure out what her  feelings for Nick really are, all while discovering  how life can change  when you break the rules every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;" />
