  <title>OH, IF I COULD BUT SHIVER! - A European Fairy Tale with a moral - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 407&lt;br /&gt;
In this 407th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;Oh If I Could But Shiver&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago a father had two sons &amp;ndash; the elder was clever and the younger stupid. Sometimes of an evening, tales were told by the fireside which made one shudder, and the listeners exclaimed, &amp;quot;Oh, it makes us shiver!&amp;quot; The younger son could never understand this saying for he had never shivered. Then the time came for the youth to learn a trade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The father confided to the parish sexton[1] who said he could teach him how to shiver and to send him over to his place. Working for the sexton, he faithfully undertook the duties assigned to him. One night he was awoken late into the night and told to go and rung the church bell. On arriving in the belfry he was about to ring the bell when a white figure appeared. The boy called out to the ghostly figure who simply stood and stared. After the incident things began to happen?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some silly and funny; and some serious. And did I hear tell of a Princess as well? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
