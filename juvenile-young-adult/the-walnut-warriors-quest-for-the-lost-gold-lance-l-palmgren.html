  <title>The Walnut Warriors® (Quest for the Lost Gold ) - Lance L. Palmgren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Delightful and whimsical, &lt;i&gt;The Walnut Warriors (Quest For The Lost Gold)&lt;/i&gt; takes young minds on a riveting adventure of good versus evil. Created by author and illustrator Lance L. Palmgren, this colorful work is the second in his &lt;i&gt;Walnut Warriors&lt;/i&gt; Series. Taking the imagination to new heights, this fascinating selection allows readers to explore the essence of bravery and determination. A one-of-a-kind tale, this beautifully crafted children&#39;s literature will amuse the youth through the endearing and admirable qualities of the feisty and courageous Walnut Warriors, who would stop at nothing to fight against bullies and oppressors. In the first book of the Walnut Warriors, readers were introduced to a world unlike any other. They were shown how the walnut characters live, their society, their rankings, along with the rules and laws in their kingdom. Readers soon become champions of the fearsome but lovable Walnut Warriors that live in a secret place, deep within their Misty Forest. This time, in Book Two of the Trilogy within the 7-Book Series, readers will follow the Warriors on their first Secret Mission into a perilous battle with their long-time enemies. Several generations ago, the Bully Boulders (who eventually transformed themselves into the Naughty Nuggets) and their Stone King attacked the Walnut Warriors and carried away their gold. To regain the treasure that is rightfully theirs, the Warriors must locate and battle the thieves into submission. Readers will be thrilled to experience, firstly, the Warriors&#39; successful search and then, the implementation of their carefully planned battle and capture strategies. Will good triumph over evil? Readers know, will you?" />
