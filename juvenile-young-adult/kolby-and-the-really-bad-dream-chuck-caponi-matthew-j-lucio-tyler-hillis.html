  <title>Kolby and the Really Bad Dream - Chuck Caponi, Matthew J Lucio, Tyler Hillis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s is one of the funniest kid&amp;rsquo;s books you will read! It&amp;rsquo;s all about a&amp;nbsp;big fat cat. (A REAL-LIFE&amp;nbsp;big fat cat with his own Facebook page!) His name is Kolby and he is a rescue cat. He&amp;#39;s had many real adventures, but sometimes we write books about adventures we think he should have had (like this one). In this book, Kolby falls asleep and dreams he is back in ancient Egypt, where they worshipped cats.&amp;nbsp;You&amp;rsquo;d think that would be a good thing, but as Kolby finds out, sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for. After a series of hilarious mishaps, Kolby wakes up back home and realizes that home is the best place to be.&amp;nbsp;The lesson is in&amp;nbsp;a low-key style that entertains and allows the parent and child to delve deeper into the meaning behind the story if they wish to. Beautifully illustrated by Tyler Hillis, this book features funny, goofy, laugh-out-loud drawings of Kolby and his many friends (along with a few enemies!). While the book is written for kids, it is also entertaining for the big kids reading the book. It will take several readings to catch all the &amp;quot;background&amp;quot; jokes going on, and sometimes a basic competancy in hieroglyphics!&amp;nbsp;Give it a read and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
