Her parents started the Jumble Players Theater together, and theater is the glue that holds her crazy family together. But when she discovers that her father&#39;s cheating on her mother with a man, Jessie feels like her world is toppling over. And on top of everything else, she has to deal with a delusional aunt who is predicting the end of the world. Jessie certainly doesn&#39;t feel ready to be center stage in the production that is her family. But where does she belong in all of this chaos?&lt;/p&gt;" />
