  <title>Love and Other Things I&#39;m Bad At: Rocky Road Trip and Sundae My Prince Will Come - Catherine Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s a girl to do when there are two guys who seem like The One?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when Courtney has found the Best Boyfriend Ever (aptly named Grant Superior), she has to leave him to go to college, because apparently the universe doesn&amp;#8217;t want her to be happy. Now that she&amp;#8217;s three states away, what&amp;#8217;s going to happen to her Superior relationship? And what about that cute guy she works with at college? No, not him. Him. Definitely getting in the way with his cuteness. But not distracting Courtney enough to make her stop wondering what exactly happened between Grant and her best friend, Beth, back home. Why can&amp;#8217;t dating be as easy as eating a healthy vegan diet? Not that she&amp;#8217;s ever managed that, either, but still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Courtney ever figure out how to get this love thing right?&lt;/p&gt;" />
