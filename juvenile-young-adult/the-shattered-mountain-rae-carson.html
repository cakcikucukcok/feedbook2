      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A powerful digital novella set in the world of Rae Carson&#39;s bestselling The Girl of Fire and Thorns series. A teenage girl must fight to survive when her village is destroyed by enemy sorcerers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Princess Elisa was being forced across the desert by a band of rebel kidnappers, her future handmaiden&amp;#8212;and best friend&amp;#8212;Mara, was fighting for survival as enemy sorcerers destroyed the countryside. This is Mara&#39;s story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mara is finally going to escape. She is in love. And even her harsh, controlling, volatile father cannot keep her from running off with the boy who makes her feel beautiful. But on the day she and Julio plan to leave their desert village, the enemy sorcerers attack, burning it to the ground. The only survivors are a handful of children, and seventeen-year-old Mara has no choice but to lead them. She must make it through the mountains to the rumored rebel camp and protect the children following her. She might lose everything&amp;#8212;and everyone&amp;#8212;she&#39;s ever loved, but what she finds will lead her down a path that will change the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t miss&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The&amp;#160;Empire of Dreams&lt;/em&gt;, Rae Carson&amp;#8217;s action-packed return to the world of The Girl of Fire and Thorns!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
