  <title>On the Road to Mr. Mineo&#39;s - Barbara O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Summer days drift by slowly in Meadville, South Carolina--that is, until Sherman the one-legged pigeon flies into town and causes a ruckus. First Stella, who&#39;s been begging for a dog, spots him on top of a garage roof and decides she wants him for a pet. Then there&#39;s Ethel and Amos, an old couple who sees the pigeon in their barn keeping company with a little brown dog that barks all night. The pigeon lands smack in the middle of Mutt Raynard&#39;s head, but he&#39;s the town liar, so no one believes him. And when Stella&#39;s brother Levi and his scabby-kneed, germ-infested friends notice the pigeon, they join the chase, too. Meanwhile, across town, Mr. Mineo has one less homing pigeon than he used to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara O&#39;Connor has delivered another ingeniously crafted story full of southern charm, kid-sized adventures, and quirky, unforgettable characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This title has Common Core connections.&lt;/p&gt;" />
