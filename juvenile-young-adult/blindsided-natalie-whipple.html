  <title>Blindsided - Natalie Whipple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An action-packed and hilarious sequel that will have you gasping, laughing, and wondering about the choices which make us grown-ups - &#39;normal&#39; or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Three months after Fiona has escaped from her father&#39;s crime syndicate, all seems well in her tiny town of Madison, Arizona. She and Seth are happy together - apart from the teensy fact that Fiona is jealous that Seth can see through her invisibility - and her family and friends are safe. But when the local syndicate and even the army show up, it&#39;s clear there&#39;s more going on in the town than she could have ever imagined. It seems like these huge powers are interested in the old Radiasure factory - could they be reproducing the infamous drug that caused mutations? - and everyone suspects Fiona of knowing more than she should. As Fiona and her friends try to cover their tracks, they discover that they do have some dangerous knowledge. Though at first determined to stop anyone from remaking Radiasure, Fiona learns a secret that could change everything, including her invisibility. Torn between her own desires and the greater good, Fiona might be too blindsided to see the real villain coming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Natalie Whipple, sadly, does not have any cool mutations like her characters. Unless you count the ability to watch anime and Korean dramas for hours on end. Or her uncanny knack for sushi consumption. She currently lives in Utah with her husband and three kids.

I love the personality and freshness Blindsided brings to superpowers! I'm secretly sobbing that there might never be another Fiona book, but I have Natalie Whipple's Relax, I'm a Ninja to look forward to this June.
