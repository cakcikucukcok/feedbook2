  <title>Bee-Come! - Tsehay Alemayehu, Maya Bazzini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This work was inspired by many who are taking positive action in whatever way they can to reverse the problem bees face to continue their existence on Earth. Bee-Come is a collection of short stories on nature written for children. It focuses on the plight of bees, highlights the interconnectedness and coexistence on Earth. The book is written for children aged 4 to 8, to facilitate connection with nature. It can also be of interest for people who appreciate bees contribution to the overall balance of ecosystem and biodiversity. It also provides a list of organizations that readers may want to know to learn and participate in conserving bees and working with nature for the overall ecological balance.&lt;br&gt;
Its so important that we recognize how interconnected and interdependent we all are for us to continue to flourish here on earth. We are all one creation. Tsehay has done a wonderful job of reminding us how precious and important bees are and what they do to support and enrich our lives. We would be lost without them.&lt;br&gt;
