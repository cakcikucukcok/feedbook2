  <title>The Forest Is Our Home - A Valentine Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Terrance was once a little boy who lived in a civilized world. But when a flash flood suddenly sweeps him downstream one day, his family believes he is gone forever. No one knows that ten-year-old Terrance has been rescued by Jim, an elderly gentleman who welcomes him into his home in the dense forest that lines the stream. Terrance is certain his father will find him eventually, but when he never arrives, Terrance is forced to adjust to a new life with a new family.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, when Terrances father receives news that his son might still be alive, he heads into the forest with his other son, Chris, where he eventually finds Terrance. After they happily reunite, they manage to convince a reluctant Terrance to leave the uncivilized world of the forest. With his wife, Anna, and their children in tow, Terrance returns home to discover that nothing is the same. While wondering if he will ever adjust to the luxuries his new life holds, Terrance knows his wife longs to return to the peaceful, beautiful forest.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this poignant tale filled with colorful folklore, a magical forest holds its power over a family as they attempt to find happiness within a civilized world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
