  <title>On the Fence - Kasie West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s a tomboy. He&#39;s the boy next door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With three older brothers, Charlotte Reynolds, aka Charlie, has always been more comfortable calling the shots on a basketball court than flirting with the opposite sex. So when her police officer dad demands she get a summer job to pay for the latest in a long line of speeding tickets, she&#39;s more than a little surprised to find herself working at a chichi boutique and going out with a boy who has never seen her tear it up in a pickup game. Charlie seeks late-night refuge in her backyard, talking out her problems with her neighbor and honorary fourth brother, Braden, sitting back-to-back against the fence that separates them. Braden may know her better than anyone. But there&#39;s a secret Charlie&#39;s keeping that even he hasn&#39;t figured out&amp;#8212;she&#39;s fallen for him. Hard. She knows what it means to go for the win, but if spilling her secret means losing him for good, the stakes just got too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Fence&lt;/em&gt; is a sweet and satisfying read about finding yourself and finding love where you least expect it. &lt;/p&gt;" />
