  <title>The Best Possible Answer - E. Katherine Kottaras</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;AP Exams - check&lt;br&gt;SAT test - check&lt;br&gt;College Application - check&lt;br&gt;Date the wrong guy and ruin everything you&#39;ve spent your whole life working for- check&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super-achiever Viviana Rabinovich-Lowe has never had room to be anything less than perfect. But her quest for perfection is derailed when her boyfriend leaks secret pictures of her to the entire school--pictures no one was ever meant to see. Making matters worse, her parents might be getting divorced and now her perfect family is falling apart. For the first time, Vivi feels like a complete and utter failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she gets a job working at the community pool, where she meets a new circle of friends who know nothing about her past. That includes Evan, a gorgeous and intriguing guy who makes her want to do something she never thought she&#39;d do again--trust. For the first time in her life, Vivi realizes she can finally be whoever she wants. But who is that? While she tries to figure it out, she learns something they never covered in her AP courses: that it&#39;s okay to be less than perfect, because it&#39;s our imperfections that make us who we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E. Katherine Kottaras once again captures what it means to be a teenager in &lt;i&gt;The Best Possible Answer&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
