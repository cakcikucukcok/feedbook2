      <meta name="description" content="Word Guild Canadian Christian Writing Award Winner 2007 - Young Adult BookGeoffrey Bilson Award for Historical Fiction Honour Book, 2007Canadian Children&#39;s Book Centre Our Choice 2007 finalistFifteen-year-old John Meyers is the youngest of the Meyers boys, with a lot to live up to. So when a routine trip to the Toronto farmer&#39;s market in the fall of 1837 turns ugly, John doesn&#39;t hesitate to jump in. George is captured, and John won&#39;t leave without him. Before long he finds himself embroiled in a real-life battle, under the leadership of Little Mac, William Lyon Mackenzie and himself.And it doesn&#39;t end when he gets back home. Though Father tries to stop it, one by one all the Meyers boys throw their support on the Reformers&#39; side. John won&#39;t let them keep him out of it. So what if fetching and carrying for a lot of crazy farmers armed with nothing but sticks and hoes wasn&#39;t exactly battle experience? It&#39;s more than his brothers have! With pretty Nan Burditt&#39;s help, John is able to follow his brothers to a small island in Canadian/US waters, the site of the rebels&#39; next skirmish.And there they are: one Meyers boy languishing in the Kingston prison while three more, John included, are camouflaged and armed and attempting to capture a steamship. How on earth did I get here? thinks John.Well, when you&#39;re a Meyers boy, these things just seem to happen! This humorous story of a boy&#39;s exploits during the Upper Canada Rebellion concludes the story of the Meyers family, Loyalists and early Canadian settlers.&quot;" />
