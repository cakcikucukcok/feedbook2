  <title>The Guardian - Joyce Sweeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hunter has never had anyone to look out for him. His mother gave him away when he was young, he&#39;s never known his father, and his foster mother leaves a lot to be desired in the mothering department. So when a mysterious, benevolent force suddenly starts coming to his aid, Hunter doesn&#39;t know what to believe. Could he really have a guardian angel? Hunter so badly wants someone to care that he&#39;s willing to take a leap of faith, and more. But when he finally learns the truth about his angel, he&#39;ll have to decide whether it&#39;s the best thing that ever happened to him or the worst. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Guardian &lt;/i&gt;is a masterful pairing of suspenseful, fast-paced storytelling with genuine compassion and heart; Joyce Sweeney at her best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
