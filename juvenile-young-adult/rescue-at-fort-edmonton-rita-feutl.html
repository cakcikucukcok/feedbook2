  <title>Rescue at Fort Edmonton - Rita Feutl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Janey doesn&#39;t want to spend the summer away from her friends in Toronto - and certainly not in Edmonton with the grandmother she hardly knows. But her parents will be away - her mother in Turkey designing housing for earthquake victims, her dad on business trips.
Her first surprise is her feisty grandma, who meets her at the airport in her vintage Cadillac, Marilyn. The second comes when she visits the Fort Edmonton historic park and time travels to 1907. The third is learning the real reason she&#39;s in Edmonton. Her grandma is going through cancer treatment and needs someone to be with her.
Janey makes four trips, each to a different period of Fort Edmonton&#39;s history. What draws her into the past? Only on the last trip does she discover the meaning of her adventures - and their crucial connection to her own family.
Rita Feutl&#39;s first novel features a deftly handled plot and a wealth of fascinating characters from prairie history." />
