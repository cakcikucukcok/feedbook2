  <title>Marilyn &amp; the Martians&#39; Paradise - Carey Ann Kramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Join Marilyn, a pretty yellow Labrador retriever, as she discovers helping others can have surprising rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marilyn, a pretty yellow Lab, is excited to be settling into her new home. Though she misses her puppy friends, she finds herself caught up in a mission to help the Martians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Martians are stuck in Marilyns backyard, and their attempts to repair their Martian Machine have failed. They are anxious to return back home and ask Marilyn if she can help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marilyn knows what it means to want to go back home. She herself was sad when she was left at the animal shelter to wait to find new owners. Marilyn does everything she can to get the Martians on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Martians and Marilyn learn that change is okay and sweet surprises can come when you try new things. What new things will Marilyn discover? Will Marilyn be able to get the Martians back home? And where exactly do the Martians consider home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of The Puppy Princess Series. Follow all of the stories from the puppies at the animal shelter waiting to be adopted. Meet the puppies in the first book in the series, The Puppy Princess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one would you adopt?&lt;/p&gt;
