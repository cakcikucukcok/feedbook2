  <title>Midway Barrel Racing Champion - David Shew, Ms. O, Melissa S. Toutant, Craig Payst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After self-publishing our first childrens book entitled Midway Dreams and hearing from other writers that they dont understand our book and hearing their questions: Is it a picture book? Or is it an entertainment book? Or better yet, is it an educational book? My sister, Rhonda, and I decided to write a second childrens book and use the same format. Rhonda will tell you that I always did travel to the beat of a different drummer and like to blaze my own trail and so does she, just ask Momma. Thats enough about that. In addition, after creating a labor of love, Midway Dreams, Melissa Shew Toutant, who is my niece, Gil and Kathys daughter and Amelias sister, asked if she could join our family team and participate in writing the second book. For those of you who are new to our Midway family, I wrote the even chapters in Midway Dreams and my sister wrote the odd chapters since she is a bit different than me. In Midway Barrel Racing Champion, I only had to write every third chapter after Melissa joined our team. By the way, Melissa, like her Aunt Rhonda, is an elementary teacher at Athens-Chilesburg in Lexington, Kentucky. Our family is so proud of Rhonda and Melissa for becoming elementary teachers. Im proud to say that we have now created our second in a series of Midway books. Hope you all enjoy Midway Barrel Racing Champion and get to know Maria, Midways new friend. Remember to read for the rest of your life and dream big dreams. Hope to see you in Midways Dreams soon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
