  <title>Fletcher: Happy Kid of Divorced Parents - Donya Fiorentino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Donya Fiorentino has written a lovely little book about a 7-year-old boy named Fletcher who is struggling with his feelings in the wake of his parents divorce. Children facing a similar fate are likely to find this book of help as they work to sort out their feelings. In particular, this book strives to alleviate the pressure some kids feel to take care of their now-divorced parents, which is best left to adults themselves. The book drives home the importance of tolerance and empathy as essential traits each and every one of us should strive to develop and possess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Richard Tuch, M.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Dean of Training, The New Center for Psychoanalysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of all marriages in the United States end in divorce, and even more endure separation. Children are often the innocent victims of this difficult fact. Frequently without even realizing it, harmful tactics are employed by both parents. These behaviors poison the atmosphere around the family in a manner that is deleterious to the young children involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with divorce and separation, its important to empower children to share their feelings openly and set strict boundaries for the adults in their lives. In Fletcher: Happy Kid of Divorced Parents, author and speaker Donya Fiorentino addresses this gap in childrens resources and helps children experiencing divorce and separation know that their thoughts and feelings are normal and important.&lt;/p&gt;" />
