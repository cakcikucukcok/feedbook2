  <title>Westminster Avenue - Wilus J. Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout the history of human beings, the question of love has always posed a problem among different racial groups around the world. But in spite of attempts to prevent such unions, human beings continue to fall in love with people outside their race, knowing they will be confronted by serious ramificationseven death!
Westminster Avenue is a novel that examines love between different ethnic couples in America during most of the twentieth century. As is the case in real life, love is the most powerful human emotion human beings experience, spanning both joy and sorrow! No one has yet figured out why people fall in love with each other. The truth is, it can be a number of reasons, including the often quoted saying Opposites attract! But this author suspects it runs much deeper than that. Whatever it is, love affects all human beings emotionally from the pinnacle of happiness to the depth of despair. Westminster Avenue examines interracial love in America in spite of the fact this culture vehemently opposes it.
Since love is ubiquitous, the author expands this novel beyond the main couple in this book to include other couples who also fall in love despite racial differences. Men and women continue to seek love even after experiencing painful relationships with a previous partner. Love is the driving force in our lives, and the truth is, people never know where they will find it. Most human beings cannot really explain what love really is, but they know they can feel it when it happens to them. That is the essence of this novel, along with the song Love Will Find a Way!" />
