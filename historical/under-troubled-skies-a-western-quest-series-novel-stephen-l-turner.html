  <title>Under Troubled Skies: A Western Quest Series Novel - Stephen L. Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="UNDER TROUBLED SKIES, the third volume in the Western Quest Series, follows Aaron Turner, his family and friends, through the tumultuous years culminating in the War for Texas Independence from Mexico. Aaron, a tall red headed forty-three year old Methodist minister and Major in the militia wants to raise his family, crops and livestock in peace along the Navasota River. But many trials will be endured and much bloodshed before he will find that peace. He is called upon by the Mexican government and his friend, Stephen Austin, to put down the Fredonian Rebellion in Nacogdoches. For his action, he is promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in command of the Northeast Texas militia. He soon finds that keeping the peace and maintaining order in such a large area is a big job. His old acquaintance, Santa Anna, prevails in a bloody civil war that leaves him dictator of all Mexico. The conflict spreads into the province of Texas, where Aaron will face him again at San Jacinto. At what price will he find the peace and prosperity he has sought in the new &quot;promised land?&quot; STEPHEN L. TURNER was born a fifth generation Texan, a sixth generation Arkansas and an eighth generation American. His youth was steeped in the history and culture of his heritage. He graduated from Texas Tech School of Medicine and has worked as a pediatrician in rural Plainview, Texas since 1984. He is married and has two adult children. He spends his free time running their panhandle ranch, raising and training horses, and hunting. He is the author of OUT OF THE WILDERNESS and ON THE CAMINO REAL, the first two volumes of the Western Quest Series." />
