  <title>Of Kings and Chronicles - Dale Pfeiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Pfeifferberg Chronicles: Book Two: Of Kings and Chronicles&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the war weary ancestors of King Iobaath, the son of Rhodanim, sojourning in Assuwa (Asia Minor or modern Turkey), of the exploratory voyage of Captain King Alanus and his pioneering sons, and of the emerging Celtic kingdoms of Europa. The first three chapters portray life in Assuwa from approximately 2500 BC to 1200 BC before Captain King Alanus, a spiritual man of great faith and obedience, makes his epic voyage from Alanya of Pamphylia (southern Turkey) to Catalonia of Europa (northeastern Spain) along familiar Phoenician trade routes to the westernmost waters of the Mediterranean Sea in Tarshish. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last four chapters portray tribal life in a young, God-fearing Europa through four successive cultures during Celtic expansion and development categorized by historians in chronological order, as follows: Tumulus culture, Urnfield culture, Hallstatt culture, and Le Tene culture. The story ends in a special period of history that Scripture labels “in the fullness of time” (Apostle Paul’s letter to Galatian Christians). This season in ancient history began during the early days of the Roman Empire after Julius Caesar conquered the wealthy Galatian confederacy who were collectively under the leadership of King Vercingetorix. As in &lt;i&gt;Book One: Descent from White Mountains&lt;/i&gt;, the timeline for the chronicle is based on the genealogy of the early British Kings, the Latin text and translation of Nenniun 17 and 18 by Nennius, published in &lt;i&gt;After the Flood&lt;/i&gt;, by Dr. Bill Cooper in Appendix 5 and 7.&lt;p&gt;" />
