  <title>The Earl&#39;s Prize (Mills &amp; Boon Historical) (Regency, Book 37) - Nicola Cornick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Although exiled to a life of genteel poverty, Miss Amy Bainbridge was a well-bred lady of honor.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when she found herself the recipient of a surprise windfall, her whole life changed! Not only did she reenter society, she also gained the attention of London&#39;s most notorious gambler–a rogue determined to claim her as his own!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joss, Earl of Tallant, was everything Amy despised in a man, but she was utterly intrigued by him. He certainly wasn&#39;t interested in her newfound fortune, so why was this renowned scoundrel pursuing her with such intent? And why was she finding his amorous attentions all but impossible to resist…?&lt;/p&gt;
