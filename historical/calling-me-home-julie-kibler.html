  <title>Calling Me Home - Julie Kibler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A National Best Seller!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Calling Me Home &lt;/i&gt;by Julie Kibler is a soaring debut interweaving the story of a heartbreaking, forbidden love in 1930s Kentucky with an unlikely modern-day friendship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty-nine-year-old Isabelle McAllister has a favor to ask her hairdresser Dorrie Curtis. It&#39;s a big one. Isabelle wants Dorrie, a black single mom in her thirties, to drop everything to drive her from her home in Arlington, Texas, to a funeral in Cincinnati. With no clear explanation why. Tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorrie, fleeing problems of her own and curious whether she can unlock the secrets of Isabelle&#39;s guarded past, scarcely hesitates before agreeing, not knowing it will be a journey that changes both their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Dorrie and Isabelle have developed more than just a business relationship. They are friends. But Dorrie, fretting over the new man in her life and her teenage son&#39;s irresponsible choices, still wonders why Isabelle chose her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle confesses that, as a willful teen in 1930s Kentucky, she fell deeply in love with Robert Prewitt, a would-be doctor and the black son of her family&#39;s housekeeper--in a town where blacks weren&#39;t allowed after dark. The tale of their forbidden relationship and its tragic consequences makes it clear Dorrie and Isabelle are headed for a gathering of the utmost importance and that the history of Isabelle&#39;s first and greatest love just might help Dorrie find her own way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
