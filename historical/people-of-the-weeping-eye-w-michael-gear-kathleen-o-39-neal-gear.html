  <title>People of the Weeping Eye - W. Michael Gear, Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;People of the Weeping Eye&lt;/i&gt; is an epic novel set against the might and majesty of the great Mississippian Chiefdoms. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling  authors W. Michael Gear and Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear have breathed new life  into North America&#39;s Forgotten Past with a sweeping saga that will  forever change your appreciation of our country.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People called Old White the &quot;Seeker,&quot; a man never long with any people or place. For years he had wandered, leaving a trail of war, wonder, and broken love in his wake. Now he is headed home, called back by visions of chaos, blood, and fire. But there is more to the Seeker than most know. He is a man driven by a secret so terrible it may topple the greatest city in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the far-off Katsinas told Old White it was time to go home, he had no idea that his journey would take him to the head of the Mississippi, where he would encounter the mystical Two Petals--a  youngsoul woman obsessed with Spirit Power, who lives life backwards. But before Two Petals can find her way out of the future, Old White must heal the rift in her tortured soul. To do so, he will need the help of Trader, a loner consumed by his own dark past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
