  <title>Mary Magdalene, the Thirteenth Disciple - Dr. Pat Kubis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A LOVE STORY, the tale of a woman who dream of love and power and found more than she dreamed.  It is a historical romance with mystical tones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Magdala 17 A.D.: the young Jewish woman, Mary is entranced by a golden lover on a white horse -- the Roman Centurion Quintus Gallus.  Sensuous, with powerful emotions, born with &quot;second sight&quot; (clairvoyance), she sees fragments of her future life.  Seduced by Quintus, she is later captured by Arabs and escapes to Caesarea, only to be thrown into a life of prostitution.  She becomes a courtesan in Caesarea, and for a time the mistress of Pontius Pilate.  But her painful love for Quintus leads to hashish and finally insanity; she is &quot;possessed&quot; by a devil, a dark voice in her mind.  Mad on the streets, and tormented by the &quot;devil&quot;, she faces stoning, but is rescued by a strange Galilean who has marvelous powers of healing: Jesus of Nazareth.  It is Jesus who reveals the real mysteries of Love to Mary and what teacher her to &quot;walk the rainbow&quot; to spiritual individuation. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pontius Pilate, the centurion Quintus Gallus, a disciple named Judas, the Devil himself, and the Nazarene prophet, Jesus are the alchemical agents that transform a prostitute into a saint --the legendary woman of the Bible who anointed the Master&#39;s feet and dried them with her hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a novel of people, adventure and passion.  It is written for every woman who &quot;loved and lost,&quot; but did not understand the significance of what happened.  This book is also a Jungian alchemical parable of transmutation and it has much meaning for those interested in mystical Christianity, yoga, holistic health, ESP, and mythology of the Joseph Campbellian variety.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Mary is a Biblical hero, but she is also the eternally questing hero of the mythic round; and if Jesus is the Biblical Christ, He is also that Magus figure who leads men to a higher state of consciousness.  This is the story of a woman of passion who achieved the gate of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every true lover ... and especially RK.&lt;/p&gt;" />
