  <title>An Irish Country Girl - Patrick Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling tale of heartbreak and hope from the author of &lt;i&gt;An Irish Country Doctor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Readers of Patrick Taylor&#39;s books know Mrs. Kinky Kincaid as the unflappable housekeeper who looks after two frequently frazzled doctors in the colourful Irish village of Ballybucklebo. She is a trusted fixture in the lives of those around her, and it often seems as though Kinky has always been there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing could be farther from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some forty-odd years before and many miles to the south, the girl who would someday be Kinky Kincaid was Maureen O&#39;Hanlon, a farmer&#39;s daughter growing up in the emerald hills and glens of County Cork. A precocious girl on the cusp of womanhood, Maureen has a head full of dreams, a heart open to romance, and something more: a gift for seeing beyond the ordinary into the mystic realm of fairies, spirits, and even the dreaded Banshee, whose terrifying wail she first hears on a snowy night in 1922. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she grows into a young woman, Maureen finds herself torn between love and her fondest aspirations, for the future is a mystery even for one blessed with the sight. Encountering both joy and sorrow, Maureen at last finds herself on the road to Ballybucklebo---and the strong and compassionate woman she was always destined to become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Irish Country Girl&lt;/i&gt; is another captivating tale by Patrick Taylor, a true Irish storyteller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
