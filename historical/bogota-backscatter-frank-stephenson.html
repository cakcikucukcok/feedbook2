  <title>Bogota Backscatter - Frank Stephenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Bogota Backscatter&quot; is a sequel to the first work of historic fiction entitled &quot;An Unlikely Journey&quot; and, like the first novel, depicts one mans struggle with the U.S. Governments hidden agenda(s) and the ongoing struggle within himself to find his place in life. Fred Sager, a Ph.D. geologist assigned to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, travels to Bogota to assist the local scientists interpretation of the horrendous January 1999 earthquakes. In no time, he also finds himself attracted to a Chinese lady, also a geologist, and also there on temporary assignment. But is she really there to help her geology brethern, or does she lead a dual life?&lt;P&gt;
The following is a brief excerpt from the book:
&lt;P&gt;
He looked at Adolph and asked, Did you understand any of that gobbledygook?&lt;P&gt;
	Yes, it was quite well articulated, in fact.  Adolph replied, his somber expression lighting up with a smile and I assumed he had decided to pay attention to what was being said after his last lapse of concentration.  Even though Fred isnt a petroleum geologist, most of us learn the basics of that branch of the discipline in undergraduate school.  Fred is good that way; he retains everything except what he had for breakfast, or where he put his car keys.&lt;P&gt;
	Sounded like doubletalk to me, Tweedledum mumbled, so what exactly are you saying then, that Okradana geologists are mistaken about the location of a rather large deposit of oil?  That theyre looking in the wrong spot?&lt;P&gt;
	Thats a distinct possibility.  I said. He failed to answer. Ill bet both of these yo-yos are attorneys, theyre sure as hell not geologists.&lt;P&gt;
	How do we know youre not lying?  Intentionally trying to throw us off the track?  Causing us to delay operations, screwing us around?  Tweedledum demanded, his voice becoming a bit hoarse and raspy now.&lt;P&gt;
	You dont know.  I replied, with a modicum of self-satisfaction in my intonation.  Youll have to take my word for it.&lt;P&gt;
	If youre lying, would you say youre lying?  He asked.&lt;P&gt;
	No, I wouldnt.  If I were lying, I wouldnt tell you I was lying, that would defeat the purpose of lying in the first place.  I said.&lt;P&gt;
	Where should they be drilling? Where is this oil reserve? He asked.&lt;P&gt;
	I dont know. I said.&lt;P&gt;
	Does this Chinese gal know? He asked.&lt;P&gt;
	Do I know if she knows? I replied.&lt;P&gt;
	If she knows would you tell me?&lt;P&gt;
	If she said I that could tell you, yes. I said.&lt;P&gt;
	And if she said that you couldnt? He barked.&lt;P&gt;
	Then I would say that I didnt know. &lt;P&gt;
	As youre saying right now. Well, at least youre truthful.  He replied, scratching his head and pacing nervously about in front of Adolphs desk.  From the expression on Adolphs face, I could see that Tweedledums response had him baffled.&lt;P&gt;
	I try. I said, again studying the quizzical look on Adolphs wrinkled face.&lt;P&gt;
	Even when you lie you seem to be truthful. Tweedledum said, Wait a minute, were talking in circles here.&lt;P&gt;
	Did you know that the ancient Egyptians didnt like pigs? I asked, trying one last time to break his spirit. Otherwise, they couldve invented ham.&lt;P&gt;
Dr. Sager, how about some straight answers to our questions?  Feigning his frustrations now, trying to conceal the fact that he knew that I knew that he was playing a game he was supposed to better at than me." />
