          &lt;strong&gt;Always The Chaperon And Never The Bride…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At least, that&#39;s the way it was for Lady Annis Wyncherley. If this young widow was to remain as chaperon to society&#39;s misses, there could be no hint of scandal attached to her name. Rakes and romance were strictly off-limits, most especially a rogue like the handsome Lord Adam Ashwick!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But that proved nearly impossible when Adam made his daughter&#39;s chaperon the subject of his relentless seduction. Adam knew any attention from him could destroy Lady Wyncherley&#39;s fine reputation. But he was powerless to control the strong desires she aroused in him. And all too soon this reformed rogue was hell-bent on convincing a very stubborn Annis to become his chaperon bride….&lt;/p&gt;
