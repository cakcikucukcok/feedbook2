  <title>Bullheaded Black Remembers Alexander - J. L. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; Before there was &lt;B&gt;Islam&lt;/B&gt;, there was Alexander. Before there was
&lt;B&gt;Christianity&lt;/B&gt;, there was Alexander. This is the story of &lt;B&gt;Alexander the
Great&#39;s invasion of the Middle East&lt;/B&gt; and of his astonishing effort to unite
the civilized world under a central government designed to promote peace and
international trade. This is the story of one man&#39;s courageous determination to
advance &lt;B&gt;freedom of religion&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;racial equality&lt;/B&gt; in Egypt,
Mesopotamia &lt;B&gt;[Iraq today]&lt;/B&gt;, Asia Minor &lt;B&gt;[Turkey]&lt;/B&gt;, Persia
&lt;B&gt;[Iran]&lt;/B&gt;, and Bactria &lt;B&gt;[Afghanistan]&lt;/B&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Why let Bucehpalus, or Oxhead (the horse Alexander rode during the ten years
of the conquest) tell this story? Because by using the famous stallion (or
Bullheaded Black, as I call him) as the narrator, it allows me to cut the story
to the bone, to cover the main facts of Alexander&#39;s life, but also to inject a
little common sense, or horse sense, if you will, about the major influences upon
Alexander&#39;s ideas and motivations: the obvious influence, for example, of his
father and mother, and the less obvious influence of &lt;B&gt;Aristotle&lt;/B&gt;, who was
his personal tutor for three or four years when Alexander was a teenager. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; This is a basic story: basic biography, basic world history, and basic
geography. This is also the story of Alexander&#39;s idea for a better world. His
dream perished with him in Babylon, when he unexpectedly died in &lt;B&gt;323BC&lt;/B&gt; at
the tender age of 33. In fact, a comprehensive dream like his, incorporating
religious freedom and racial equality, did not flower profusely again until
&lt;B&gt;1776&lt;/B&gt; in America, and did not shoot promising tendrils forward again in
&lt;B&gt;Iraq&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/B&gt; until the United States of America&#39;s
preemptive strikes in the &lt;B&gt;21st Century&lt;/B&gt;. What would Alexander say to us
today about disputes over religion and the various gods of the world&#39;s great
faiths? &lt;U&gt;Read this book! You will be surprised! &lt;/U&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
