          &lt;strong&gt;ABANDONED&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Parkins had been left in the wilderness, along and destitute, by a man she&#39;s promised to love, honor and obey. Now fate had led her to Brice Graham, who offered her fulfillment of all her dreams. But the price, she soon learned, would be her heart and soul… !&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;BEREFT&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Elizabeth Parkins rode into his life, Brice Graham saw a way out of the loneliness that haunted his days. Here was the wife of his heart, the true mother of his child. But would she be content to pretend they&#39;d been together forever - or would she demand something more… ?&lt;/p&gt;
