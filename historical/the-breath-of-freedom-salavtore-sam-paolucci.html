  <title>The Breath of Freedom - Salavtore (Sam) Paolucci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; Gerog Yakov, in 1915, was a 19 year old young man who was raised in the bosom of a loving family. He attended a small college. There he became aware of the horrible poverty that existed among the serf farmers of Russia. During his first year of school he joined the Bolshevik Revolutionary party. Together they were going to change the lives of the peasants by giving them a share in the farms that would be run by the party. In 1917, after a violent revolution the Bolsheviks became the supreme rulers in all of Russia. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For 20 years Gerog served his party at a low level job that was his reward for his loyalty. By 1937 his ferver had changed to fear. Nothing had changed for the poor. But the changes that occurred within the party were appalling. Anyone who questioned the party were eliminated. Thousands of people simply disappeared. No one was safe. Not even Gerog or his family. And to make matters worse the army was controlled by the Communists. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During the year of 1937 Gerog began developing a plan to get his son, his wife, and their 5 year old child out of Russia to where the breath of freedom was enjoyed by millions of Americans. By 1938 his plan is ready. He gathers his family and explains it to them. Gerog and his wife will not be going with them. If anything goes wrong they know they will all be killed. As the plan proceeds an unfortunate event occurs. Gerog has to improvise. At the last moment, totally unexpected, he is helped by a complete stranger.&lt;/P&gt;" />
