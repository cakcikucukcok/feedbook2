  <title>The Crime Writer - Jill Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From acclaimed novelist Jill Dawson comes this imaginative psychological thriller&amp;#8212;a dark and compelling snapshot into the life of Patricia Highsmith that immerses readers into the intoxicating, nightmarish psyche of this brilliant, complex author.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When novelist Patricia Highsmith moves into a small cottage in Suffolk, England, in the mid-1960s, she&amp;#8217;s seeking seclusion and time to write. There&amp;#8217;s another reason for seeking privacy too&amp;#8212;Pat is involved in a secret romance with Sam, a married woman living in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even in this quaint village, Pat can&amp;#8217;t escape the obligations of her success. A young reporter, Virginia &amp;#8220;Ginny&amp;#8221; Smythson-Balby, sets her sights on Pat for an article she&amp;#8217;s writing. Ginny is both tenacious and oddly familiar, but Pat can&amp;#8217;t quite place where she&amp;#8217;s seen her before. Intent on unearthing details about Pat&amp;#8217;s fascination with not just the subject of murder but the psychology of a murderer, Ginny constantly intrudes into the sanctuary Pat had hoped to create, much to her dismay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Pat observes, love is a kind of madness. And when Sam comes for a visit, tension between Pat and Sam&amp;#8217;s husband escalates with deadly results. For so long she&amp;#8217;s wondered what it would feel like to commit the ultimate transgression. Now she&amp;#8217;s not just a chronicler of murder and violence, but a participant as she becomes a character from her own thrilling, disturbing novels. But just like her books, she discovers crime has consequences&amp;#8230;dark, surprising, and inescapable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill Dawson deftly explores the public and private life of one of the most intriguing writers of our time, blending fact and fiction in a novel as thrilling as Patricia Highsmith&amp;#8217;s own work. &lt;/p&gt;" />
