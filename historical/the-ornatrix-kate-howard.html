  <title>The Ornatrix - Kate Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In this exquisitely dark debut,  Kate Howard delivers a stirring tale on the cost of beauty, packed with  suspense and period detail worthy of Kate Mosse, Jessie Burton, and Tracy  Chevalier.Cursed from birth by the  bird-shaped blemish across her face, Flavia spends much of her life hidden from  the outside world. Lonely and alienated even from her family, she sabotages her  sister&#39;s wedding in a fit of jealous rage and is exiled to serve in the convent  of Santa Giuliana. Soon she finds that another exile dwells in the convent: a  former Venetian courtesan named Ghostanza whose ostentatious appearance clashes  with the otherwise austere convent and sparks gossip throughout the town.    When Ghostanza claims Flavia as her  ornatrix--her personal hairdresser and handmaid--Flavia is pulled into a world of  glamor and concealment where admiration is everything and perfection is the  ultimate, elusive goal. And she soon finds that with beauty in her grasp, in  the form of the poisonous but stunning white lead cerussa, Flavia will do  anything to leave her marked face behind.Rich in  description and character, Kate Howard&#39;s stunning novel is painted against a  vivid historical landscape with themes and characters relevant today, tackling  issues of belonging, female identity, and the perception of beauty.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
