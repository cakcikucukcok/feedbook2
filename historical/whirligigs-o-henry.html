      <meta name="description" content="Settle in for a whimsical, thoroughly enjoyable whirlwind tour through the prodigious imagination of American short-story master O. Henry. When he wrote the following, he may have discounted his own creativity. „Whirligigs”, comprised of 24 short stories and published in 1910, is evidence of this. O. Henry writes of love and loss, of mystery and drama, of journalism and murders and trials. He creates a tapestry of characters, young and old, wealthy and poor. It offers some of his best short stories; complete with quirky characters, witty romps with clever twists and surprise endings. If you love classic O. Henry stories like „The Gift of the Magi” and have been curious about the rest of this beloved author’s body of work, „Whirligigs” is a great place to start." />
