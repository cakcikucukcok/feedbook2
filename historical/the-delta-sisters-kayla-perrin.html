  <title>The Delta Sisters - Kayla Perrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From &lt;i&gt;Essence&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kayla Perrin comes the compelling story of three generations of African-American women---of their deepest secrets and most cherished lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grayson family is a pillar of the African-American community in New Orleans. But Sylvia Grayson, the matriarch, has deep secrets that she conceals beneath a veneer of propriety. She keeps a tight rein on her daughter, Olivia, and has the perfect life mapped out for her: go to college, join the Delta sorority, and marry the proper boy. After the town&#39;s &quot;bad girl&quot; is found murdered one summer day in 1975, Sylvia pulls Olivia even closer. But when Olivia&#39;s one last attempt at rebellion is subverted by her mother, Sylvia&#39;s relentlessly tight hold shatters the ties between them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, Olivia&#39;s own daughter, Rachelle, is trying to make her way in the world. Olivia does not want to make the same mistakes as her mother, nor does she want her daughter to repeat the errors Olivia made out of rebellion. Meanwhile, a killer is watching from the shadows, determined to bring the secrets of the past to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Delta Sisters&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping, intimate portrait of what happens when these passionate women have to band together at last in the face of danger.&lt;/p&gt;" />
