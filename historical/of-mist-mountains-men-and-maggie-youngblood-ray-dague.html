  <title>Of Mist, Mountains, Men and Maggie Youngblood - Ray Dague</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Travel back to 1863 to a small mountain town, Seasonsville, in South-Central West Virginia that is embroiled in the American Civil War. The battles in this local conflict were not that of vast armies like those that clashed in Gettysburg or Antietam. Rather, the struggle is between small groups and individuals. The novel Of Mist, Mountains, Men and Maggie Youngblood: A Civil War Story of Tragedy and Triumph is an account of very personal relationships. Discover how the context of war influences the way people interact. Ordinary life becomes tangled and uncertain, and relationships intensify.
Join Maggie Youngblood on a trip that, although not lengthy in distance, travels deep into the human spirit. Experience intense dread and fear as a murderer prowls the countryside. Laugh at the antics of brothers. Feel tenderness when the human touch is gentle. Know sorrow and rage when war becomes personal. Be inspired by heroic acts. Be excited by romance and love. Be horrified by violence.
All these experiences with the human spirit are all the more captivating by virtue of intrigue. Who will live? Who will die? Will justice prevail? Can there be justice in war? How will relationships endure? Who will win and who will lose? How will all this be resolved? The tension made by the interaction of the characters as they meet with uncertainty will create a yearning to live with them episode after episode." />
