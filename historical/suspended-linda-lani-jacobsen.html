  <title>Suspended - Linda Lani Jacobsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some days are more memorable than others. As pregnant Molly enjoys an early morning walk on an Oahu beach, she suddenly sees planes flying overhead. Her heart seems to stop as she notices the markings on the planes. Her muscles seem to desert her, leaving her motionless. Even her unborn baby makes no move. What has started as a beautiful day has now turned into the beginning of an unimagined nightmare. It is December 7, 1941.&lt;br&gt;
Fear overcomes Molly as she runs to her cottage, screaming for help. As the other residents in the small homes are awakened by the planes and her cries, everyone is transfixed as they look upward. Confusion soon turns to horror as the planes reach Kaneohe Naval Air Base, and the sound of explosions and gunfire fill the air. While some go to the base to help, Molly and Ed, along with others, evacuate their homes and head for the mountains with no idea of what to expect. Everything is about to change forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on extensive research, &lt;i&gt;Suspended &lt;/i&gt; narrates the impact on the civilian residents living in Hawaii after the bombing, including martial law restrictions, friendships, and, for some, adventure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
