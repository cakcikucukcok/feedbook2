  <title>Treason&#39;s Truth - Jeffrey Underwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This slice of historical fiction begins with the ancient vampire entity of The Forbidden Tome; Hansel and Gretels True Tale and of Lethal Assumed; Lost Tome Found, not in Germany of the 1850s or present day Seattle but in the days of yore when Scotland was in Mother Earths womb and about to be birthed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tale of Cinaed Mac Alpin , known commonly as Kenneth, and his queen Aiobheean, opens as his life is fledgling and he is a boy of seven in 818AD British Isles. So much is primitive but moving towards formation of a nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale of the story is huge. And yes, it involves vampires and passionate embraces of significant characters in history. Yet the book also includes the sweep of one hundred and forty critical years in the building of that romantic land they now call Scotland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered about what truly ensued with the incident known as Mac Alpins Treason? Or with the clash of the Pictish and Gael cultures and with how the Pictish way of life vanished? Where did those tattooed people go? Or with how the Catholic Church brought its weight upon the land? Find answers, sophisticated answers, in this rendering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are descriptions of the people who allowed this time to flow down upon the world. There are births, deaths, passion, sadness and the tumultuous turmoil of a bold but wild era. Sink your teeth into this tale. &lt;/p&gt;" />
