  <title>The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells - Andrew Sean Greer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Confessions of Max Tivoli&lt;/em&gt; comes &lt;em&gt;The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells&lt;/em&gt;, a rapturously romantic story of a woman who finds herself transported to the &amp;#8220;other lives&amp;#8221; she might have lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the death of her beloved twin brother and the abandonment of her long-time lover, Greta Wells undergoes electroshock therapy. Over the course of the treatment, Greta finds herself repeatedly sent to 1918, 1941, and back to the present. Whisked from the gas-lit streets and horse-drawn carriages of the West Village to a martini-fueled lunch at the Oak Room, in these other worlds, Greta finds her brother alive and well&amp;#8212;though fearfully masking his true personality. And her former lover is now her devoted husband&amp;#8230;but will he be unfaithful to her in this life as well? Greta Wells is fascinated by her alter egos: in 1941, she is a devoted mother; in 1918, she is a bohemian adulteress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this spellbinding novel by Andrew Sean Greer, each reality has its own losses, its own rewards; each extracts a different price. Which life will she choose as she wrestles with the unpredictability of love and the consequences of even her most carefully considered choices?&lt;/p&gt;" />
