  <title>Drummer&#39;s Luck - Jon Bezayiff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;DRUMMERS LUCK&lt;/I&gt; is based upon actual events that occurred in Americas Revolutionary War at the surrender of Yorktown in 1781 when a young British drummer boy resolutely stood silhouetted on a parapet under fire from Continental riflemen to beat out a call to parley. &lt;I&gt;DRUMMERS LUCK&lt;/I&gt; begins on the grim streets of Edinburgh Scotland where Ossian, an orphaned choirboy of 11 is cruelly pressed into Britains Royal Navy to serve as a powder monkey aboard a ship of the line. Born under mysterious circumstances and raised by a secretive mother, Ossian is unaware his unknown father, chieftain of Scotlands most powerful clan and a lethal duelist, is seeking him. Ossian learns to survive by wits and courage on a man of war that is little more than a floating prison as he begins a dangerous journey that will lead him from the horrors of eighteenth century naval warfare to the battlefields of Cornwallis&#39; campaign in the Carolinas and Virginia. From the dangers of life at sea to the plantations of South Carolina, &lt;I&gt;DRUMMERS LUCK&lt;/I&gt; is the story of one young boys frightening discovery of his true identity while seeking a new life for himself in America." />
