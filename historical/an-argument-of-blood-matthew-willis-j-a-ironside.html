  <title>An Argument of Blood - Matthew Willis, J.A Ironside</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;William, the nineteen-year-old duke of Normandy, is enjoying the full fruits of his station. Life is a succession of hunts, feasts, and revels, with little attention paid to the welfare of his vassals. Tired of the young duke&amp;rsquo;s dissolute behavior&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
and ashamed of his illegitimate birth, a group of traitorous barons force their way into his castle. While William survives their assassination attempt, his days of leisure are over. He&amp;rsquo;ll need help from the king of France to secure his dukedom&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
from the rebels.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other side of the English Channel lives ten-year-old &amp;AElig;lfgifa, the malformed and unwanted youngest sister to the Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson. &amp;AElig;lfgifa discovers powerful rivalries in the heart of the state when her sister Ealdgyth is given in a political marriage to King Edward, and she finds herself caught up in intrigues and political maneuvering as powerful men vie for influence. Her path will collide with William&amp;rsquo;s, and both must fight to shape the future.&lt;br /&gt;
An Argument of Blood is the first of two sweeping historical novels on the life and battles of William the Conqueror.&lt;/p&gt;" />
