  <title>Wentworth-By-The-Sea, 1969 - Susan Chapman Melanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1969 was a pivotal year for the Wentworth-By-The-Sea grand hotel that dominated the Portsmouth, NH seacoast since the turn of the century. It was the end of an era when patrons stayed for the entire summer, crystal fingerbowls were expected and the James Barkers Smiths personally attended to the needs of their guests. This book is written from the point of view of a waitress who observed 1969 from &quot;the back of the house&quot;. It describes the inner workings of the kitchens and dining rooms, the employee subculture and captures a moment in time. 1969 was the year of Woodstock, and The First Man on The Moon, and Chappaquidick. There are local legends, the music of the day, a love story and a cast of colorful characters. And if you happened to have been there in 1969 and think a particular fictional character sounds familiar -- it probably is." />
