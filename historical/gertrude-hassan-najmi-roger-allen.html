  <title>Gertrude - Hassan Najmi, Roger Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;As Hassan Najmi&amp;#8217;s acclaimed novel begins, our unnamed narrator befriends an elderly man, Muhammad, who, as a young man, worked as a tour guide in the city of Tangier. Muhammad tells the narrator about his most famous clients, the renowned Gertrude Stein and her companion Alice Toklas, who&amp;#151;on the recommendation of Henri Matisse&amp;#151;hired Muhammad as their guide when they visited Morocco. Now close to death, Muhammad begs the narrator to take his papers and write his life story.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Soon we learn that Muhammad once accepted Stein&amp;#8217;s invitation to visit her in Paris, and even lived for a time in a roof-top room in her apartment. There he participated in Stein&amp;#8217;s famous salon, meeting Picasso, Appollinaire, Hemingway, Anais Nin, and the many other luminaries in Stein&amp;#8217;s circle. As the narrator is drawn further into Muhammad&amp;#8217;s story, he finds himself also drawn into a relationship with the cultural attach&amp;#233; at the American Embassy in Rabat, a beautiful African-American woman who becomes as interested in the story of Stein&amp;#8217;s visit to Morocco as she obviously is in the young Moroccan who is researching it. Together they continue their quest into the past to rediscover Stein, a quest that will take them in unexpected new directions, in a novel that bursts with different varieties of passion at the hands of a master storyteller and poet.&lt;/div&gt;" />
