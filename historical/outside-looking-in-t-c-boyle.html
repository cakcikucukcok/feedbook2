  <title>Outside Looking In - T.C. Boyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A provocative new novel from bestselling author T.C. Boyle exploring the first scientific and recreational forays into LSD and its mind-altering possibilities&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this stirring and insightful novel, T.C. Boyle takes us back to the 1960s and to the early days of a drug whose effects have reverberated widely throughout our culture: LSD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1943, LSD is synthesized in Basel. Two decades later, a coterie of grad students at Harvard are gradually drawn into the inner circle of renowned psychologist and psychedelic drug enthusiast Timothy Leary. Fitzhugh Loney, a psychology Ph.D. student and his wife, Joanie, become entranced by the drug&amp;#8217;s possibilities such that their &amp;#8220;research&amp;#8221; becomes less a matter of clinical trials and academic papers and instead turns into a free-wheeling exploration of mind expansion, group dynamics, and communal living. With his trademark humor and pathos, Boyle moves us through the Loneys&amp;#8217; initiation at one of Leary&amp;#8217;s parties to his notorious summer seminars in Zihuatanejo until the Loneys&amp;#8217; eventual expulsion from Harvard and their introduction to a communal arrangement of thirty devotees&amp;#8212;students, wives, and children&amp;#8212;living together in a sixty-four room mansion and devoting themselves to all kinds of experimentation and questioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is LSD a belief system? Does it allow you to see God? Can the Loneys&amp;#8217; marriage&amp;#8212;or any marriage, for that matter&amp;#8212;survive the chaotic and sometimes orgiastic use of psychedelic drugs? Wry, witty, and wise, &lt;em&gt;Outside Looking In&lt;/em&gt; is an ideal subject for this American master, and highlights Boyle&amp;#8217;s acrobatic prose, detailed plots, and big ideas. It&amp;#8217;s an utterly engaging and occasionally trippy look at the nature of reality, identity, and consciousness, as well as our seemingly infinite capacities for creativity, re-invention, and self-discovery. &lt;/p&gt;" />
