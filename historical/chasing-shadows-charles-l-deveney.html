  <title>Chasing Shadows - Charles L. Deveney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="London, in the autumn of 1888, is a city gripped in fear. The infamous Jack The Ripper is prowling the streets, viciously butchering East End prostitutes in a series of crimes that are shocking the world. The Commissioner of Scotland Yard, Sir Charles Warren, responds to the madness by appointing the dashing, self-assured, Donald Swanson to lead the investigation into the horrific crimes. As Swanson wades further and further into the bizarre facts of the case, he slowly discovers that the murders are not the random acts of brutality that they appear, but rather cold and calculated assassinations. As he digs deeper, he slowly uncovers the unbelievable and shocking motives behind the killings.&lt;p&gt;
At the same time that Swanson&#39;s investigation is progressing, an American tourist, Jim Daulton, is falling in love with a young, beautiful woman named Mary Davis. Their romance is deep and intense until Jim learns that history has marked her to be the final Ripper victim. As Jim struggles to save Mary from her grim fate, he will unknowingly provide Donald Swanson with the missing facts that he needs to expose the killer&#39;s identity as well as the ancient secret brotherhood upon whose orders he is acting.&lt;p&gt;" />
