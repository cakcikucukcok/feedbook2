  <title>An Irish Doctor in Peace and at War - Patrick Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doctor O&#39;Reilly heeds the call to serve his country in &lt;i&gt;Irish Doctor in Peace and At War,&lt;/i&gt; the new novel in Patrick Taylor&#39;s beloved Irish Country series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#39;Reilly became a fixture in the colourful Irish village of Ballybucklebo, he was a young M.B. with plans to marry midwife Dierdre Mawhinney. Those plans were complicated by the outbreak of World War II and the call of duty. Assigned to the HMS &lt;i&gt;Warspite&lt;/i&gt;, a formidable 30,000-ton battleship, Surgeon Lieutenant O&#39;Reilly soon found himself face-to-face with the hardships of war, tending to the dreadnought&#39;s crew of 1,200 as well as to the many casualties brought aboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life in Ballybuckebo is a far cry from the strife of war, but over two decades later O&#39;Reilly and his younger colleagues still have plenty of challenges: an outbreak of German measles, the odd tropical disease, a hard-fought pie-baking contest, and a local man whose mule-headed adherence to tradition is standing in the way of his son&#39;s future. Now older and wiser, O&#39;Reilly has prescriptions for whatever ails...until a secret from the past threatens to unravel his own peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting deftly between two very different eras, Patrick Taylor&#39;s latest Irish Country novel reveals more about O&#39;Reilly&#39;s tumultuous past, even as Ballybucklebo faces the future in its own singular fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
