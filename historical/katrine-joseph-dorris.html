  <title>Katrine - Joseph Dorris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1862 as nine-year-old Katrine Larson heads west to a mountain valley in preIdaho Territory with her family and several other Swedish families. But when her parents and older brother are separated from the main wagon train, Katrine suddenly becomes an orphan.
The Swedish families want nothing more than to create new lives in America. Unfortunately none are prepared for the brutal realities of farming in wilderness populated by Sheepeater Indians and wild gold prospectors. After Sven and Margret Olafson welcome Katrine into the folds of their family, she never loses hope of one day reuniting with her parents and brother. Katrine knows her place will be to marry and raise children, but her dreams dim as the Swedes struggle to survive amid tragedies. Although Katrine and her adoptive younger sister celebrate traditions with other Swedish children, it is a German hurdy-gurdy girl who teaches Katrine about sacrifice and love. But it is not until the magic of Swedish fairy tales and childhood romance is stripped away that Katrine is finally able to see the realities of adulthood.
Katrine: High Valley Home shares an unforgettable glimpse into a young girls coming-of-age journey as she clings to hope and attempts to survive among the wilds of 1800s Idaho." />
