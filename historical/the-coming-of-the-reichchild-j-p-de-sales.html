  <title>The Coming of the Reichchild - J. P. De Sales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the 1990s, George Bush Sr. called Saddam Hussein this modern day Hitler.  THE COMING OF THE REICHCHILD is a visceral, highly visual story that deftly weaves historical fact with fiction to revel the chilling, all-too-plausible roots of the Iraqi dictator. Built convincingly around real historical events and personages, THE COMING OF THE REICHCHILD accurately traces the life of Saddam Hussein tying his roots to Adolph Hitler and the Third Reichs need for oil.  The novel chronicles the diabolical events of another time when a seed was planted whose bitter fruit would be harvested by a future age, and traces Husseins collision course with the Jews whom he vowed to incinerate with his Scud missiles during the Persian Gulf War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By his own admission, Saddam does not know who his real father was, and was raised by an uncle whom history reveals to be an ardent pro-Nazi. And how is it that German companies were so deeply involved in building his legendary underground bunkers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where fact stops and fiction starts is indiscernible, yielding a fascinating novel that is filled with suspense, intrigue, violence, treachery, and the ultimate love of a man for his daughter. Truly, a what if novel to end all what ifs.&quot;" />
