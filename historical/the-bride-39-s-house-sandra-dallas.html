  <title>The Bride&#39;s House - Sandra Dallas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Whiter Than Snow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Prayers for Sale&lt;/i&gt; comes a novel about the secrets and passions of three generations of women who have all lived in the same Victorian home called the Bride&#39;s House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1880, and for unassuming seventeen-year-old Nealie Bent, the Bride&#39;s House is a fairy tale come to life. It seems as if it is being built precisely for her and Will Spaulding, the man she is convinced she will marry. But life doesn&#39;t go according to plan, and Nealie finds herself in the Bride&#39;s House pregnant---and married to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pearl, growing up in the Bride&#39;s House is akin to being raised in a mausoleum. Her father has fashioned the house into a shrine to the woman he loved, resisting all forms of change. When the enterprising young Frank Curry comes along and asks for Pearl&#39;s hand in marriage, her father sabotages the union. But he underestimates the lengths to which the women in the Bride&#39;s House will go for love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan is the latest in the line of strong and willful women in the Bride&#39;s House. She&#39;s proud of the women who came before her, but the Bride&#39;s House hides secrets that will force her to question what she wants and who she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandra Dallas has once again written a novel rich in storytelling and history, peopled by living, breathing characters that will grab hold of you and not let you go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
