  <title>A Lost Generation - Ronald S. Zimney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nearly fifty years old and widowed for the last ten, Lilly Larsen understands that Roger Hartec could be a heartbreaker. First, theres his age. Roger is more than ten years younger than she. And the rumor mill in Ashland Falls, Minnesota, says he might have a penchant for violence, which she witnesses him exercise.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At the local museum, Roger, a Vietnam War veteran, throws a park bench through a plate-glass window that had been protecting a display of the American flag being desecrated. In spite of his violent action, Lilly finds herself attracted to this tall, strong man because of the tenderness he displays with the crying Cub Scout in her charge. With the help of two close friends, Lilly is determined to make a new life with this enigmatic and troubled veteran.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Together Lilly and Roger embark on a journey of creating a diverse family of rejected individuals. Surmounting one obstacle after another, with the help of an ever-growing circle of friends, this loving couple has no idea of the far-reaching impact their union has made on their community. A story of confession and redemption, A Lost Generation showcases the struggle for survival of a Vietnam combat veteran as he reenters society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
