Michael Gear&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is 1850 in St. Louis, and Abriel Catton receives the last will and testament of his father, Web catton, an enigmatic mountain man. Among the papers are instructions the Ab must reassemble his family: brother and sisters he can barely remember, that separated after the death of his mother. Together they will search for Will Catton&#39;s legacy, all the while pursued by Braxton Bragg and his desire for revenge and gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in pursuit of the Cattons is General Cavaignac. Fresh from fighting in Algeria, and now struggling for control of France, Cavaignac has heard rumors that the legacy of France is hidden somewhere in the American West. the skeins of Catton involvement are spun through L&#39;Overture&#39;s revolt in the Dominican Republic, to Algeria, and now Cavaignac&#39;s agent Leander Sentor, is narrowing his pursuit on Arabella, Ab&#39;s sister, and the rest of the Cattons. Sentor will not rest until he recovers the legacy of France for his General, and repays Arabella for meddling in French affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a race to the finish as the Cattons seeks to outmaneuver their pursuers and locate Web Catton&#39;s legacy. But first, the Cattons must renew the bonds of a family shattered by time and distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
