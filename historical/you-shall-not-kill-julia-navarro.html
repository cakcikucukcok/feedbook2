Her family has come to ruins  during the Civil War and in order to confront their debts, her father plans to marry her to a man she despises. &lt;B&gt;Eulogio&lt;/B&gt; is the one whose  war losses are greatest. His father died in combat and he himself  returned from war a cripple after a heroic act which saved Marvin&#39;s  life, a young American who arrived in Spain in 1936 to study literature,  and when war broke, decided to stay and portray the pain of conflict in a celebrated poem anthology.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The future&#39;s perspectives look grimmer each day for the three friends.  They decide to unite their destinies and embark on a new life away from Madrid to save the little that they have left.&lt;/P&gt;" />
