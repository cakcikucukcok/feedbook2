  <title>Aleut Princess - Loretta Sanford Cuellar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With a father who is chief of a village of almost two hundred Aleut people, Anna Hasson grows up a real Aleut princess. But everything changes when she turns fourteen. A year after Anna is kidnapped outside her seaside home and thrust into the white mans world, World War II begins and the Aleut race falls just short of complete annihilation through genocide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later in the early 1950s and living in Juneau Alaska a disheveled Anna is rescued from a small tenement room and taken to the hospital. At one time, Anna had been stunningly beautiful, but now, she is disheveled and filled with shame and secrets she does not want anyone to know. The only way she knows to numb the pain is to drink herself into oblivion. Now with death seemingly imminent, Annas path crosses with that of a kindly nun who must rely on her faith and Gods grace to guide Anna back in time to where the truth hopefully waits. But will Anna be able to attain the inner-peace she so desperately needs before it is too late?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical novel, an Aleut woman lost in the world of alcoholism must rely on help from a devoted nun to rediscover her love for her people, her culture, and most importantly, herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
