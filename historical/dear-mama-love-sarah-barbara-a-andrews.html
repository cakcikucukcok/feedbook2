  <title>Dear Mama, Love Sarah - Barbara A. Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Mama, Love Sarah . . . Did You Hear Me Cry?&lt;/i&gt; tells of suffering, love, and redemption. Sarahs Patriot family disowns her when her husband, Reuben, remains a Tory and leads a regiment in the Battle of Ramsours Mill where the Patriots are victorious and the Tories routed. Wanted by his enemies, Reuben hides leaving Sarah to tend a large plantation under enemy siege, rear thirteen children, and await his return. When he reunites with his family, Sarah strugggles as he refuses to accept himself as vanquished. They are forced to move to the squabble lands of the frontier and Kentucky. Through all, almost twenty years, Sarah writes Mama, reminiscing her past happy childhood, telling the joys and sorrows of her children and pleading for reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their shattered lives, Reubens belief that the British would win cuts their lifes thread,separating their hearts from each other. Years pass before he realizes that it is Sarahs forgiveness which makes them one again. Kentucky strong, she no longer blames him, but loves him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconciliation with Mama does not come. At the news of Mamas illness, Sarah and her thirteen children desperately trek to North Carolina to reach Mama before she dies, but arrives too late. Mama, in death, finds a way to tell Sarah she loved her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
