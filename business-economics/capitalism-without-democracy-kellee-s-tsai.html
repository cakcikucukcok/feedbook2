  <title>Capitalism without Democracy - Kellee S. Tsai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; Over the past three decades, China has undergone a historic transformation. Once illegal, its private business sector now comprises 30 million businesses employing more than 200 million people and accounting for half of China&#39;s Gross Domestic Product. Yet despite the optimistic predictions of political observers and global business leaders, the triumph of capitalism has not led to substantial democratic reforms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;P&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Capitalism without Democracy&lt;/em&gt;, Kellee S. Tsai focuses on the activities and aspirations of the private entrepreneurs who are driving China&#39;s economic growth. The famous images from 1989 of China&#39;s new capitalists supporting the students in Tiananmen Square are, Tsai finds, outdated and misleading. Chinese entrepreneurs are not agitating for democracy. Most are working eighteen-hour days to stay in business, while others are saving for their one child&#39;s education or planning to leave the country. Many are Communist Party members. &quot;Remarkably,&quot; Tsai writes, &quot;most entrepreneurs feel that the system generally works for them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;P&gt; Tsai regards the quotidian activities of Chinese entrepreneurs as subtler and possibly more effective than voting, lobbying, and protesting in the streets. Indeed, major reforms in China&#39;s formal institutions have enhanced the private sector&#39;s legitimacy and security in the absence of mobilization by business owners. In discreet collaboration with local officials, entrepreneurs have created a range of adaptive informal institutions, which in turn, have fundamentally altered China&#39;s political and regulatory landscape. Based on years of research, hundreds of field interviews, and a sweeping nationwide survey of private entrepreneurs funded by the National Science Foundation, &lt;em&gt;Capitalism without Democracy&lt;/em&gt; explodes the conventional wisdom about the relationship between economic liberalism and political freedom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
