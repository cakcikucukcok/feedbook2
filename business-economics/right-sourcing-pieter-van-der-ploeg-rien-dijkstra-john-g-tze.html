  <title>Right Sourcing - Pieter Van der Ploeg, Rien Dijkstra, John Gøtze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Right Sourcing - Enabling Collaboration&lt;/i&gt; puts forward the proposal that the modern enterprise must fundamentally rethink its sourcing equation to become or remain viable. By presenting perspectives on sourcing from 21 different contributors, the editors hope to enable and inspire readers to make better-informed decisions.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sourcing is a business theme which gets more and more attention. But making the right decisions is not easy. Sourcing is a wicked problem. This book provides valuable insights and concepts that will help to improve decisions with regard to sourcing. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to achieve right sourcing.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sourcing is becoming an increasingly complex task  one that requires fundamental changes in management thinking, radical new ways in which to communicate and deal with knowledge, and a totally new and different view of all the stakeholders. In this book leading thinkers in this space, do a great job in opening up the readers mind to possibilities for alternative solutions that integrate the human aspects in everything we do.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What most impressed me about this book is the scope of its coverage, and the level of academic rigor behind the analysis. The broad scope makes this relevant to senior executives concerned with strategy, operational executives accountable for results, and technologist on the ground. The academic rigor gives me confidence that the findings and recommendations are sound.  This book will be the reference guide for anyone seriously involved in strategic sourcing.

Thought provoking, occasionally frustrating and timely! As the theory of the firm is tested with evolving technology and globalization driving down transaction costs and enabling greater connectivity were presented with many different possibilities for business operating models. By exploring the perspectives of organization, economics, technology and people this book provides the reader with a compendium of theory, ideas and practical tips on Right Sourcing the business of IT and enabling different business models. The slightly idiosyncratic nature of a book with contributions from different authors only serves to engage the reader in the discussion. I hope the editors find a way to continue this discussion beyond the book!

The pursuit of sustainable development is one of the greatest challenges of our time. For this to succeed we must transform our current linear economy to a circular one. This calls for better coordination and collaboration between all players in product chains. Right-sourcing people, products and services is becoming an increasingly important topic therefore. This book provides the reader valuable insights and food for thought on right sourcing and collaboration.
