Good leaders make their vision a reality and think objectively  2. Leaders identify target markets and position their enterprise  3. Leaders make financial decisions and harness cash flows  4. Leaders develop the culture and build operations manuals  5. Leaders analyze and improve all the systems of the business  6. Leaders give existing and new customers opportunities to buy  7.
