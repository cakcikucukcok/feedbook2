  <title>Financial Elites and European Banking - Youssef Cassis, Giuseppe Telesca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What role have the financial elites in European societies and markets played over time? What was their contribution to the recent financial collapse, and how does this compare to previous crises? How have financial elites adjusted to, or influenced, the evolution of the financial system&#39;s regulatory framework over time? Financial Elites and European Banking: Historical Perspectives is a collection of essays dedicated to the European financial elites and the
current debate on the role of experts within society.
The ambiguities of the globalized economy over the last thirty years, epitomized by growing levels of inequality, have generated a feeling of distrust towards experts. Financial elites have become one of the most scrutinized targets of negative public opinion, triggered by the financial crisis, the high compensations enjoyed both before and after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the obscure nature of their activity. Financial Elites in European Banking presents historical
comparisons and country and cross-country case studies on financial elites&#39; adaption and contribution to the transformation of regulatory and cultural context in the wake of a crisis." />
