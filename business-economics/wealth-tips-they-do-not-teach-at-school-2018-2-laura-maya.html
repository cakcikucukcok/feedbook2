  <title>Wealth Tips  They  Do Not Teach at School (2018, #2) - Laura Maya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t teach you how to get rich at school,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sick of&amp;nbsp; Hearing&amp;nbsp; the Same Old Advice ? &amp;ldquo; Word &amp;nbsp;Hard , Control your expenses , Credit Card&amp;nbsp; is a&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;No&amp;nbsp; , NO &amp;ldquo; Do not get into Debt&amp;nbsp; !!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Debunk&amp;nbsp; all those assumptions that&amp;nbsp; you will be&amp;nbsp; Rich&amp;nbsp; if you study hard and work&amp;nbsp; hard . This Book&amp;nbsp; is actually&amp;nbsp; not one of those .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wealth Tips&amp;nbsp; They&amp;nbsp; Do Not Teach at School&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
is all about the importance of money. The premise of the book clearly distinguishes the difference between the thinking of the rich and the poor. In essence, the only limitation between you and the rich is in your own mind, and achieving success lies in breaking these walls. At schools, you would have been stuck at algebra, Pythagorean Theorem, and organic chemistry but you never study financial planning, making money, or saving money. The book provides real-life examples to reprogram your thinking to that of the rich and wealthy.&lt;br /&gt;
You can&amp;#39;t just graduate and leave&amp;nbsp; formal&amp;nbsp; education&amp;nbsp; and expect yourself to be&amp;nbsp; financially well equipped. Many people thought &amp;nbsp;that having a&amp;nbsp; good education &amp;nbsp;is sufficient&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; hop on the train&amp;nbsp; to &amp;nbsp;acquire new wealth&amp;nbsp; , well they can&amp;#39;t be any more wrong !&lt;br /&gt;
As a kid, I have been told that getting good grades and a good job is the ladder to financial freedom. It&amp;#39;s a sham. Everything boils down to your financial decisions and this book provides a great foundation to teach you those.&lt;br /&gt;
This book is &amp;nbsp;comprehensive, crisp, and easy to read. And by &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; I mean this book provides sound information on the importance of money. It clearly distinguishes the difference between the thinking of the rich and the poor. The biggest revelation for me was that the author is right! They never taught me how to be rich at school.&lt;br /&gt;
It is having the mindset of the wealthy that will make you rich&amp;nbsp; You&amp;rsquo;ll discover why&amp;nbsp; some of your money beliefs might be wrong and&amp;nbsp; that could be holding you back , you&amp;nbsp; need to consider&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; what are the principles and what behaviors the rich have , that&amp;nbsp; you&amp;nbsp; do not have ,Yet !&lt;br /&gt;
Laura Maya takes this idea and updated&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; it to &amp;nbsp;Sixteen chapters. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t find a recipe to turn rich overnight. Rather, the book provides a solid foundation for setting the psychological stage for strong financial habits.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;The premise of this book is straightforward &amp;ndash; Rich people are programmed to think differently. Essentially,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; rich people and poor people think differently. This book walks you through these&amp;nbsp; beneficial points clearly differentiating how rich and poor people think.&lt;br /&gt;
Studying hard, getting nice grades, and getting a job is not enough to be rich. That&amp;rsquo;s one lie which we have been fed with since our childhood. There is a difference between scholastic, professional and financial education. The book further analyzes the root cause of why you are not rich. It all boils down to your education. You were never taught about how to be rich at school. Forget that, you never even learned personal finance or how to handle money. It further touches upon how you can get smart with personal finance.&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps the biggest argument Laura makes is the fact that everything can change if you change your mindset. Buying that expensive dress, impulsive buying, etc. are all signs of a poor mentality. If you make changes to your lifestyle and spending habits today, you will reap the benefits tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
On making money, Laura&amp;rsquo;s approach is simple &amp;ndash; she emphasizes on investing, spend less, and plan for a long-term.&amp;nbsp;" />
