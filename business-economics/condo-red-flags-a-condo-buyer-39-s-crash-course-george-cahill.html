  <title>Condo Red Flags: A Condo Buyer&#39;s Crash Course - George Cahill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From The Author Admittedly,I have made numerous mistakes during my long and rewarding career as a condo expert. To say the least, These mistakes have taught me valuable life lessons.  I have done my best, therefore, to put these mistakes to pen and discuss them in this Condo Buyer&#39;s Crash Course.  Since this is a &quot; Crash Course&quot; please note I have limited my writing to what I consider the most important topics for buyers to understand and pitfalls to hopefully avoid.  In the guide I  often refer to these mistakes,  as Red Flags. In my opinion, This buyers guide is an absolute must read if your just starting out in your search for a condo . This guide could also be invaluable if your on a tight schedule and under the gun to make a decision on weather or not to move forward with your condo purchase.  I discuss briefly in the guide the pros and cons of condo ownership." />
