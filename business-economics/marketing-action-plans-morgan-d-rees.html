Morgan Rees has put it all together in &lt;i&gt;Marketing Action Plans,&lt;/i&gt; a concise, step-by-step book with bottom line guides and strategies that will take your company from invisible to remarkable. Its like having your own marketing department available to you, twenty-four hours a day, every day!

Some customization will be necessary to fit the needs of your organization, but a substantial part of your plan, layout, and content are provided. 
&lt;i&gt;Marketing Action Plans&lt;/i&gt; is a year-round resource tool. Its not the kind of book that sits on your bookshelf at home; rather, it is an important tool that can guide you through the development of plans for your company or organization.
