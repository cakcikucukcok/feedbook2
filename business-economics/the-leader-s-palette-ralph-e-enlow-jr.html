  <title>The Leader’S Palette - Ralph E. Enlow Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No! Not another book on leadership! That was my first reaction as I received the manuscript of this book. Upon careful reading, I came to realize that Dr. Enlow has artistically captured the essence of leading by influence and has presented it in a clear and colorful way. As a veteran leader, Dr. Enlow speaks from vast experience, but it is not merely subjective anecdotal experience. The book is firmly rooted in serious and current research. As I meet leaders from all over the globe, I am no longer hesitant what to recommend them to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riad Kassis, director of Langham Scholars Ministry; international director of the International Council for Evangelical Theological Education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book under-promises and over-delivers with a powerful palette of leadership wisdom. But drop everythingright nowand read the warning in the last chapter on doxological leadership.  I am recommending this book to all my clientsand I will likely reread this gem once a year. Its that important.&lt;/p&gt;
