  <title>Wouldn&#39;t It Be Better If.......? - Philip Langford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Successful and effective management are critical to the well being and stable governance of organisations. However, all too frequently those in management positions are untrained, unqualified, unprofessional, stuck in a do as I say, or else, mentality and often seem incapable of making rational, logical judgements.
The author examines some high profile examples, sometimes with a little humour, but also some of the day to day ongoing mistakes which are made by those in management roles simply because of flawed, well established, entrenched and ineffective ways of behaving and going about things.
Philip Langford has spent twenty years working inside a wide range of organisations, across the globe as a management consultant and has found significant problems to the ways in which many organisations function. 
His book describes many of the bizarre and extraordinary shortcomings over  21 topical sections and explains how most of these can be overcome with a shift in the thinking and behaviours of managers at all levels. This book is, at times, scathing in its criticisms.
It also challenges the peculiar notion that managers need to become leaders in order to have credibility and succeed. His contention is that organisations desperately need both effective management and quality leadership if they are to succeed in the fast paced, constantly changing, business world of the 21st century." />
