  <title>Finding Your Niche - Dee Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A million new businesses will start each year in
North America and 60 percent will begin at home,
according to government statistics. However, experts
agree that the long-term success rate tends to be
poor - only two out of every 10 new businesses will
succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people choose the wrong kinds of self-employment: ventures that don&#39;t fit their true skills or talents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a new book has been developed to address these
issues. By reading it, budding entrepreneurs will
learn how to answer such crucial questions as: &quot;Which
business should I start?&quot; and &quot;What business is most
likely to thrive?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finding Your Niche: Discover a Profitable Idea
for a Business at Home-or Elsewhere&lt;/i&gt; covers the
common mistakes and pitfalls that confront would-be
entrepreneurs. Articles by industry and academic veterans are included. Written in a seriocomic style, the book offers valuable ideas that will help you to uncover a winning idea or plan a specific startup. And you will save time and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Features:&lt;/b&gt; Adobe Digital PDF, printing, hyperlinks, advanced navigation, word search, bookmarks, and highlighting.
