  <title>Self-Managed Superannuation in Retirement: a Personal History Through the Global Financial Crisis - Robert T. Gemmell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a personal story and is in no way to be taken as financial advice. I have described the successes and failures that were experienced during the ten years from 2005 to 2016, a time when the financial markets plunged due to the global financial crisis (GFC) and the subsequent recovery. Investments were made in stocks, property trusts, mortgage funds, and fixed interest. With this approach, an annual income from dividends and franking, distributions, and fixed interest was maintained. Although the capital and income were reduced from 2008 through to 2016, they have increased annually. Long may it continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the fund was started in 2005 and double-figure returns were received through 2006 to 2008. At this time, the investing game seemed easy. Everything changed with the GFC. The value of our shares decreased by 56 percent and the fund by 40 percent; it was a worrying time for everybody. In this book, the changes made to the portfolio to combat the fall in income and value of the fund are described. And although in 2016 the fund has not reached 2007 levels, it shows signs of recovery.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book does not outline a fail-safe method for running a self-managed superannuation fund. Do not believe anyone who professes to have one. However, the information provided hopefully will encourage other retirees who wish to set up their own self-managed superannuation funds. Inevitably, mistakes will be with made. Everybody will make the wrong choices at times and lose money. In the long run, one just has to pick more winners than losers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
