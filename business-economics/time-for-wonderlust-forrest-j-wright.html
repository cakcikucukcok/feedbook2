  <title>Time For Wonderlust - Forrest J. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RETIREMENT AS YOUR LAST SECOND CHANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;Wonderlust&amp;quot; book speaks to those over 50 who are looking to rededicate their lives to something other than work. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to know where to turn after a long career, so this book offers four helpful concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUR NEW FUTURE MAY LIE IN YOUR PAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably had miraculous experiences in your life that are not fully appreciated for their significance. Revisiting them with a fresh perspective as described in &amp;quot;Wonderlust&amp;quot; could renew your sense of uniqueness and meaning and provide a strong foundation to pivot in exciting new directions.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Trying to understand these peak experiences--moments of transcendence--can create curiosity about how they affect others. Can we look for answers in the arts, philosophy, or psychology? Learning about the Axial Age and pleasures of the mind can not only be fun but create wonderful moments of happiness as you find meaning in retirement.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Full retirement provides the best environment--when work concerns don&amp;#39;t compromise your limited free time--to explore these concepts. Considerable financial planning, though, is needed to insure comfortable full retirement living.&lt;br /&gt;
4. You learn about the threats to finding leisure time, such as conspicuous consumption, and how you can &amp;ldquo;own your job&amp;rdquo; even before you retire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
