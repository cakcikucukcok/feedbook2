  <title>Ghoulsquad - Jerry DeCastro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1968, during the height of the Vietnam War, Dr. Blacktea travels with a group of scientists to a decrepit hospital in a remote part of South Vietnam in hopes of creating a new kind of super solider. He finds four perfect candidates: Four-eyes, Shades, Bullrider, and Yankee. These four young men wake to know something is different about them, but theyre not sure what.&lt;p&gt; 
On a practice mission, their helicopter is shot down and crashes in the jungle. Somehow, the soldiers survive and eventually find their way back to Dr. Blackteas hospital only to find it destroyed. Theyre in need of answers, and their answers wait at Camp Eagle. Led by Four-eyes, the men trek through the jungle as an unsatisfied hunger for human blood threatens their sanity.&lt;p&gt; 
The four super soldiers soon realize they must make a wartime choice: Samson versus Gunner. Samson hopes to become the next dictator of Vietnam with the help of Four-eyes and his men. Gunner has similar ambitions to rule the jungle, also with their assistance. Will Dr. Blackteas experiments choose sides or use their newfound power to establish a world of their very own?&lt;p&gt;" />
