  <title>A Nearly Normal Family - M.T. Edvardsson, Rachel Willson-Broyles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;...A compulsively readable tour de force.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; recommends M.T. Edvardsson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Nearly &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Normal Family&lt;/i&gt; and lauds it as a &quot;page-turner&quot; that forces the reader to confront &quot;the compromises we make with ourselves to be the people we believe our beloveds expect.&quot; (&lt;i&gt;NYTimes Book Review&lt;/i&gt; Summer Reading Issue)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;M.T. Edvardsson&#39;s &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Nearly Normal Family&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; is a gripping legal thriller that forces the reader to consider: How far would you go to protect the ones you love? In this twisted narrative of love and murder, a horrific crime makes a seemingly normal family question everything they thought they knew about their life--and one another.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eighteen-year-old Stella Sandell stands accused of the brutal murder of a man almost fifteen years her senior. She is an ordinary teenager from an upstanding local family. What reason could she have to know a shady businessman, let alone to kill him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stella&#39;s father, a pastor, and mother, a criminal defense attorney, find their moral compasses tested as they defend their daughter, while struggling to understand why she is a suspect. Told in an unusual three-part structure, &lt;i&gt;A Nearly Normal Family&lt;/i&gt; asks the questions: How well do you know your own children? How far would you go to protect them?&lt;/p&gt;" />
