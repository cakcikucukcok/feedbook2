      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;How do you catch a killer who knows your every move?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The woman lay flat on the table, her face to one side, her wrists bound with thick tape. Deep scratches marked the wood beneath her fingers, now resting cold and still...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a woman&amp;#x2019;s body is found in an abandoned bar near the Southampton docks, &lt;b&gt;Detective Kate Matthews&lt;/b&gt; is called in to lead the investigation. She must solve this case to prove she is coping with the death of a close colleague. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate knows a pile of ripped up newspaper cuttings discovered at the victim&amp;#x2019;s house must be a piece of the puzzle, but her team keep hitting dead-ends... Until she finds a disturbing clue that convinces her of three things: &lt;b&gt;The murder is linked to the body of a man found hanging in a warehouse, she is on the hunt for a calculated serial killer&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;the killer is watching her every move.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate realises there will be another victim soon, and that her own life is in grave danger, but no one else believes her theory. &lt;b&gt;Can she find and stop the most twisted killer of her career, before another life is lost?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An absolutely NAIL-BITING thriller that will keep you guessing to the very last page.
