  <title>Project X-Out - Alexander R. King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This planet is filled with all types of criminals. Some act out with rage and kill other people, while others are reckless and abuse drugs, but the one type that no one seems to take as seriously is a school bully. Bullying affects everyone in different ways. It can even change a good person to become a bad one. I was one of those good people. Once upon a time
This is a story about a boy, Lex Rivers, who, through his entire life, was bullied and hated by everyone but his family. He had little to no friends while in school, but the friends he did have he cherished so deeply and would do anything to protect them.
He keeps a journal which he writes in on a regular basis. Inside this journal at the back is a list of people along with a small report of what kind of person they are and how they have mistreated others in the past. Rivers has plans to kill everyone who&#39;s name is written in his journal. One by one he plans out how, when, and where he is going to kill these individuals. He has many obstacles and trials to complete while deciding if he really wants to kill these people. The largest one being a girl he fell in love with. The only girl who can change his vicious way of life." />
