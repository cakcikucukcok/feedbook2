      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Joshua&#39;s Hammer &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;High Flight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Bay of Bengal a civilian research vessel witnesses a submarine fire a laser into the sky. Before they can process what they see, the sub blasts them out of the water and captures the lone survivor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, one of the United States spy satellites becomes inoperative, and seemingly disappears. With the United States blind, Pakistan plans to announce their presence as a nuclear threat with an attack on India that would leave millions dead.&lt;br&gt;The only witnesses to the plan, and the only ones to know that the bomb is small enough to be dropped from an aircraft, are a CIA insertion team, headed by the President&#39;s own brother, former Navy SEAL lieutenant Scott Hanson. Their knowledge may prevent a nuclear holocaust, but they&#39;ve been captured and tortured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrust into the action is Commander Frank Dillon, Jr., commanding officer on the American nuclear sub &lt;i&gt;Seawolf&lt;/i&gt;, together with a team of SEALs. Their mission is to get them back safely. But with the world on the brink of war, getting out may be the greatest challenge of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
