  <title>Winding Back the Clock - Ian Laurence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="American lawyer Katie Talbot is on the trail of the treasures that were looted from her ancestral home on the island of Rgen by two brothers, who were agents of the secret police in the days of the former East Germany. Detlef Weber is also on the trail of the brothers, as they murdered his father. The paths of Katie and Detlef criss-cross as they each pursue their quest, but both get caught up in the rise of a new far-right political party in Germany that is threatening the stability of Europe. It all comes to a climax in Weimar, the center of so much culture and political history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author Ian Laurence has done a masterful job here, weaving well-developed characters into an imaginative plot that builds interest chapter after chapter. He successfully connects his fiction to history, adding enough factual details to make the story believable without overwhelming it. In addition, Laurence knows when to drop in critical foreshadowing to keep readers guessing. It is sure to please fans of suspense novels who appreciate thought-provoking history skilfully cross-connected with a credible and vivid story line.&lt;br /&gt;
- Blueink Review&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laurence keeps readers guessing about the outcome until the very end. A whirlwind trip around the globe, a little glamour, and a lot of intrigue.&lt;br /&gt;
- ForeWord Reviews (Clarion Review)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Winding Back The Clock is fast moving and energetic, full of plots and counter-plots. The author has obviously done his research, and the historical information is clearly presented, although sometimes too didactically. The interplay of the different characters, with their different motivations, is well drawn, and the villains are downright chilling.&lt;br /&gt;
