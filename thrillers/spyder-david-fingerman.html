  <title>Spyder - David Fingerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet Spyder, a street-wise antihero of inner city society. Experience his strange wisdom, and his twisted sense of humor in this urban noir tale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thirty-year-old Spyder doesn&amp;#39;t waste time thinking how much lower he can sink. When he finds his girlfriend dead as the result of drugs he supplied, Spyder contemplates his life and decides it&amp;#39;s time to do what he&amp;#39;s avoided most of his days-join mainstream society. All he needs to do is kick the drug habit, find a job, a place to live, and earn some money. Easy. He&amp;#39;s done it hundreds of times, but never all at once.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As always, Fate steps in and knees him in the groin. All the dregs he&amp;#39;s ever known want their say. George won&amp;#39;t stop his pestering, Sal needs a huge favor, Coon is hunting for a certain arachnid, and Spyder&amp;#39;s dealer doesn&amp;#39;t want to lose one of his best customers. As things spiral out of control, Spyder tangles himself in a web so tight that even he might never be able to escape.&lt;/p&gt;" />
