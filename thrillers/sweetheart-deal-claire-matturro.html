  <title>Sweetheart Deal - Claire Matturro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarasota lawyer Lilly Cleary has had her share of odd cases. She&#39;s defended everyone from a pet psychic to an orange libeler, and she&#39;s done so with finesse. But it&#39;s another situation entirely when she finds out that her phobic and dysfunctional mother has been accused of murder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she&#39;s been estranged from her family for years, Lilly drops everything to return to the little town of Bugfest, Georgia, and steps into more than she bargained for. For one thing, her mother&#39;s house is beyond a mess. Important papers are missing, and on the back porch there&#39;s a freezer whose contents are very odd. Bugfest itself is under attack by developers who want to turn it into a resort community, a plan that would displace many of the longtime residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then someone tries to murder Lilly&#39;s mother with red ants while she&#39;s strangely oversedated in the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly has come to the rescue, but can she get to the root of these mysterious doings in time to save her mother&#39;s life? &lt;/p&gt;" />
