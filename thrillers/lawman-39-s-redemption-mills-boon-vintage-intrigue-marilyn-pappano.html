  <title>Lawman&#39;s Redemption (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Marilyn Pappano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Hallie Madison couldn&#39;t help but reach out to the brooding lawman, to help him connect with the lonely teenager who might be his daughter–who needed him to be her father. She risked her tattered heart on a man who couldn&#39;t promise her anything and a girl who was someone else&#39;s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Life had taught Brady that the safest way to live was alone, but after one night with Hallie, alone was the last thing he wanted to be. And when his newfound &quot;daughter&quot; wound up kidnapped, Brady knew there was nothing he wouldn&#39;t do for the women he loved and the chance to be a family.&lt;/p&gt;
