  <title>Elipsions - Gregory Morrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Calebs mother dies suddenly from brain cancer, While mourning the loss of his much loved mother he begins to suffer vivid, terrifying dreams. Worse, when he wakes, he finds himself scraped, bruised, and bleeding from the frightening experiences in his dream world. During the nightmare, Caleb receives a mysterious message that says he must find Elise Sullivan-Magaskawa, a young woman in serious trouble who lives in Devils Lake, North Dakota. Caleb knows hell be dead if he goes back to sleep, so he skips his high school final exams. He finds Elise and learns shes running away from an abusive stepfather and his psychologist friend who want to keep her silence by admitting her into a mental institution. After escaping with Elise, Calebs dreams ensue, causing severe burns to Calebs body while specific directions to locate and unite with Derrick are received. The clock is ticking on Calebs survival, but he&#39;s given relief and the most extraordinary love imaginable from Aubrey. Theyre embroiled in a race to locate their final group member and to attempt to discover the reason theyve been brought together. Throughout the journeys this unlikely ban of teens with a rape victim, drug dealer, isolated mamas boy, prom queen and a  schizophrenic must each battle his/her own demons, mentally as well as physically, which takes every ounce of their special abilities to overcome. Their religions are challenged, racial barriers crossed, self-images shattered as they embark upon alternate perceptions of life and death as well as alternate energy sources that just might save mankind and our planet Earth." />
