  <title>Abuse of Power - Michael Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk-show host Michael Savage comes a high-intensity debut thriller, the story of a smeared network journalist who uncovers a chilling terrorist plot. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Hatfield is a hardened former war correspondent who rose to national prominence for his insightful, provocative commentary. But after being smeared as a bigot and extremist by a radical leftist media-watchdog group, he ultimately loses his job and finds himself working in obscurity as a freelance news producer in San Francisco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One afternoon Hatfield is on a ride-along with the SFPD bomb squad when a seemingly routine carjacking turns deadly, after police find several pounds of military-grade explosives in the jacked car. And when the FBI urges Hatfield to stay out of it, he knows he&#39;s onto something big.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This event will open up a shadowy trail that leads Hatfield from San Francisco to Tel Aviv, London, Paris, and back again, as he works with a stunning Yemeni intelligence agent and a veteran Green Beret to expose a terrorist group known as the Hand of Allah--and a plot within the highest corridors of power that will dwarf September 11th.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Abuse of Power &lt;/i&gt;is a lightning-paced thriller, spanning the globe from Europe and Israel to the back alleys of San Francisco&#39;s Chinatown. Jack Hatfield must make the choice between protecting his own life and investigating a terrorist cell whose goal is nothing less than total political control--no matter what the cost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
