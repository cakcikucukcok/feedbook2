  <title>Do You Know a Serial Killer? - Thirlena Rivera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She was like a goddess with her earth brown eyes and beguiling and bewitching smile. Before Caul could make sense of the mirage before him the images began to change. His children and their mothers stood still, as if frozen in time. Their smiles and out stretched arms disappeared. They all stood there looking at him with what appeared to be begging eyes with tears running down their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death knelling Caul had heard earlier began again. This time it was louder and stronger and instead of a single voice, there were many. A cacophony of howling whiles. Why daddy, why daddy, why daddy? Why did you do this to us? And just above the childrens wailing the voices of two women began to echo in the background. They were crying out in unison for him to take them but not their babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While trying to shake off the memories, Caul asks of himself what is the worst thing a person can do to his family? Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, the voices shouted out to him in a cacophony of howling whiles, like the death knelling hed heard so often during battles in Nam.&lt;/p&gt;" />
