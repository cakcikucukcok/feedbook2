  <title>The Black Sun - James Twining</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a secret that has been hidden for more than a half century. . . . The clues have been scattered across the globe. Now someone has begun to piece them together&amp;#8212;and the future of the world depends on his being stopped in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Maryland, a vicious gang breaks into the National Cryptologic Museum and steals a Nazi Enigma machine. In a London hospital, an Auschwitz survivor is murdered in his bed, his killers making off with a macabre trophy&amp;#8212;his severed left arm. In Prague, a seemingly worthless painting is stolen from a synagogue. Three cities. Three puzzling thefts. Could there possibly be a connection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When former art thief Tom Kirk is first asked to investigate, the Prague theft certainly seems unremarkable enough&amp;#8212;until the stolen painting turns up alongside the amputated human arm. As Tom digs deeper into the past, both items appear to be elements in an elaborate trail of clues laid down in the dying days of the Third Reich by a secret order of SS knights&amp;#8212;clues that stretch from the remote mountains of Idaho to the snowy streets of St. Petersburg and ultimately lead to a fabled treasure lost in the ashes of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spurred on by the sinister light of the Black Sun emblem, ghosts from his past, and the poisonous manipulations of a deadly enemy, Tom finds himself trapped in a situation where the greatest prize of all is life itself&amp;#8212;and not just his own. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
