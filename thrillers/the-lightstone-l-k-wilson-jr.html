  <title>The Lightstone - L.K. Wilson Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An evil force arises twice every hundred years.  A young man has his destiny forced upon him to fight this evil power. Brey is the last of the Turjim, the human warrior the fights by the good wizard&#39;s side, Halloc. Halloc is loyal to the king, but a higher purpose controls his thoughts.  Halloc must take young boy and turn him into a man in less than three days.  He needs the help of more humans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The life of Brey unfolds.  It almost crumbles when his father is murdered.  It reaches new heights when he meets a pretty servant girl at the royal castle.  Questions fill his mind, but with each new answer comes another thousand questions.  Who murdered his father?  How did his mother die?  What secret does his best friends, Stik and Prat, hide from everyone? What curse does the royal family hide? How can a young boy become a man in three days?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   The wizard gives Brey the Lightstone, the one talisman that can vanquish the evil wizard forever.  It can conquer any wizard.  Five humans and a wizard set out on their quest. The journey is full of surprises. There is truth within lies, and deceit amid sincerity, love fed by hate, and serpent&#39;s venom within a dove&#39;s tear. Their lives will never be the same, if they live at all.  Among them is a wizard killer.&lt;p&gt;" />
