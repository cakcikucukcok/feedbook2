  <title>The Last Hack - Christopher Brookmyre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Internationally bestselling author Christopher Brookmyre, winner of the McIlvanney Prize for Scottish Crime Novel of the Year and finalist for the CWA Goldsboro Gold Dagger for his most recent novel, &lt;EM&gt;Black Widow&lt;/EM&gt;, is renowned for his black humor, remarkably well-drawn characters, and killer twists. His new Jack Parlabane thriller, &lt;EM&gt;The Hack&lt;/EM&gt;, is his most unstoppable novel yet.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sam Morpeth has had to grow up way too fast, left to fend for a younger sister with learning difficulties when their mother goes to prison and watching her dreams of university evaporate. But Sam learns what it is to be truly powerless when a stranger begins to blackmail her online, drawing her into a trap she may not escape alive. Meanwhile, reporter Jack Parlabane has finally got his career back on track, working for a flashy online news start-up, but his success has left him indebted to a volatile source on the wrong side of the law. Now that debt is being called in, and it could cost him everything.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Thrown together by a common enemy, Sam and Jack are about to discover they have more in common than they realize—and might be each other’s only hope. &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
