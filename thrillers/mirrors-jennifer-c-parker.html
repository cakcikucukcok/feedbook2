  <title>Mirrors - Jennifer C. Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Time-travel into two different dimensions to discover two different hauntings thatll change your psychological view of fear.
		After surviving life on the run as a blacksmith from an old murder mystery that he was unaware of, 10 years later, Chester finds himself in a reality that leaked his haunted conscience into reality to torture his un-rested soul through the eyes of a Gypsy he fell in love with on his journey. Every time he thought he was innocent, the haunting became stronger. Little did he know, he was the haunting of 1920 and his love played a role that would change his life and societal views. Do you think you can solve the mystery? Or, will you become another victim?
After encountering a near tragic experience, Jake finds out about a world that appears to be an endangerment to his dimension through his nightmares. When the creatures transitioned into his dimension, they came as a warning in knowing that one day his world would become just like theirs. He finds out that he is the only one who can stop the puzzle behind the worlds development from prevailing and prevent the supernatural force from taking over his dimension. Or did he? 
	Based on the poem called Mirrors from my well-known book, Poetic Visions through the State of Mind. This book takes your fear to its limits of looking into the eyes of the paranormal. The chilling feeling that this science fiction thriller will leave on your soul will alter your views on reality. Will you survive to make it to the end of the book?" />
