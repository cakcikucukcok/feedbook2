  <title>Scripted Destiny - Sarah Hoad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scripted Destiny is the fifth book in a young adult, fantasy/thriller series. 
Four girls have already told their story; four girls have been left in despair after the attacks of the immortals. Within the mortal world, their lives had been filled with torture, and separately they were left for death to consume their souls. However, there was a prophecy created in the immortal world, and the immortals will defy every law of their own world to see that prophecy fulfilled. 
Taken from the mortal world to that of the immortal, the four soul children are not only left to fight the demon that has destroyed their lives but to battle alongside their immortal familiars in a supernatural war. The prophecy has the potential to restore their lives, save the mortal and immortal worlds. If they fail, evil could destroy everything they have worked toward. Can they put aside their differences and memories to fight the immortals, or will the power of the gods conquer them first?" />
