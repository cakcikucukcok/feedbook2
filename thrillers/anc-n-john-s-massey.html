  <title>Ancón - John S. Massey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are many moving parts to Masseys fascinating(and) complex thriller&quot; Kirkus Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ever since the day they met as children while she was flying a kite on the beach, wealthy businessman Bernardo and brilliant scientist Emelia seemed destined to one day become husband and wife. They did eventually marry, but years later, that romantic dream is destroyed when Bernardos beloved is seemingly assassinated for dark, ambiguous reasons. Understandably aghast, Bernardo struggles to understand why anyone would want to murder his adoring wife. His shock and dismay shouldnt be wholly unexpected, however, because a group of powerful, ruthless people has come to desire his demise as well. Although he has skillfully presented himself to the wider world as a successful importer, Bernardo is actually a member of a clandestine group of powerful men who have discovered the lost treasures of the Incan civilization. For years, the secretive Cndores De Oro  have used their riches to manipulate political power and perpetuate their hold on the treasure trove of unimaginable riches hidden in the Peruvian mountains; woe to anyone who runs afoul of their aims. Eventually, Bernardo does just that as Emelias dangerous work in GMO foodstuff surfaces on a parallel track.&lt;/p&gt;" />
