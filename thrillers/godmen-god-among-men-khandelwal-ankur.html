  <title>Godmen: God among men - Khandelwal Ankur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DVM is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest marketing company. It manages politicians, religious leaders, celebrities, and even assassins. Unknown to most, its in??uence grips and controls every part of society. DVM uses its clients to create its own version of order in a seemingly tumultuous social climate. Its only agenda is the business progression of its clientele.&lt;br /&gt; Armed with this goal, DVM&amp;rsquo;s members relentlessly execute operations with motives that seem illogical and usually borderline immoral, engineering public sentiment along the way. Daniel Aegnor is a new hire, a talented employee at DVM, introduced to this high stakes, glamorous world thanks to his skill of detecting and manipulating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As newbie Daniel learns more about DVM and its practices, he learns secrets that change his life forever&amp;mdash;and not necessarily for the better. Daniel soon discovers the bare bones his world stands on using tactics that shock him and change him every step of the way. This is what happens when men play God, and it can&amp;rsquo;t possibly end well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
