  <title>The Final Warning - George Newberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Final Warning is a psychological thriller based on a documented true story. Many of the unexplainable supernatural events that occur in this story are based on actual events confirmed by court records and the legal depositions of witnesses.
Father Tony DiMarco, an expert at deciphering ancient scrolls, was transferred from his parish in Los Angeles to a secret chamber deep in the bowels of The Vatican. He discovered messages hidden in  ancient  scrolls. They revealed the devil had challenged God. He claimed that with more power over the world, he could win more souls than God and destroy mankind.  God accepted the challenge and granted the devil one-hundred years to prove it. The devil chose the Twentieth Century.
The devils reign is over, but he left the world in chaos. Many powerful men and government leaders were greedy and corrupt. Their lust for power, fortune and fame, even at the expense of others, became their Golden Calf.
Premonitions, a near-death experience, and visions gave Father DiMarco and his niece Amy Anderson, a common destiny. They must warn mankind to get their lives in order with God and start living by The Golden Rule, before its too late.. Their efforts to fulfill their mission placed them in the midst of a battle between the forces of good and evil.  They were being watched by an evil eye. They were attacking evil and they soon learned evil attacks you back.  Many supernatural experiences confronted them on their journey, but they were not going  to let the  forces of evil win. They had to fulfill their mission." />
