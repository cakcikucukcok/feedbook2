  <title>Divorce and the Holy Puck - Richard L. Becker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sam Oliver is a meek, plain-looking divorce lawyer and youth hockey coach with a comatose social life and an immunity to his clients&#39; suffering. But when a hockey player&#39;s mother shows up in his office seeking a divorce, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam is immediately attracted to the drop-dead gorgeous Rebecca Warren, despite his disappointing realization that she is just another crazy hockey mom. Rebecca believes her ten-year old son, Donnie, will become the world&#39;s greatest hockey player. Sam doubts it and also doubts a woman like Rebecca would ever want to be with him. Sam is used to being alone - he copes with loneliness by entrenching himself in a fantasy world dominated by a sleazy divorce lawyer and his paralegal lover, Fay Blondeshell. But Donnie turns out to be a superstar and Sam&#39;s attraction to Rebecca brings his fantasy world to life, plunging him into a web of ruthless office politics, adultery, blonde sirens, maniacal parents, sports betting and quantum physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Divorce and the Holy Puck&lt;/i&gt; is a darkly humorous tale that depicts a lonely divorce lawyer&#39;s outlandish attempt to make sense of a world gone crazy-searching for the answer to the all consuming question, &quot;Who am I?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
