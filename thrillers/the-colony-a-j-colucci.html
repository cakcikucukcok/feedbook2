  <title>The Colony - A. J. Colucci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A series of gruesome attacks have been sweeping New York City. A teacher in Harlem and two sanitation workers on Wall Street are found dead, their swollen bodies nearly dissolved from the inside out. The predator is a deadly supercolony of ants--an army of one trillion soldiers with razor-sharp claws that pierce skin like paper and stinging venom that liquefies its prey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desperate mayor turns to the greatest ant expert in the world, Paul O&#39;Keefe, a Pulitzer Prize-winning scientist in an Armani suit. But Paul is baffled by the ants. They are twice the size of any normal ant and have no recognizable DNA. They&#39;re vicious in the field yet docile in the hand. Paul calls on the one person he knows can help destroy the colony, his ex-wife Kendra Hart, a spirited entomologist studying fire ants in the New Mexico desert. Kendra is taken to a secret underground bunker in New York City, where she finds herself working side by side with her brilliant but arrogant ex-husband and a high-ranking military officer hell-bent on stopping the insects with a nuclear bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ants launch an all-out attack, Paul and Kendra hit the dangerous, panic-stricken streets of New York, searching for a coveted queen. It&#39;s a race to unlock the secrets of an indestructible new species, before the president nukes Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.J. Colucci&#39;s debut novel is a terrifying mix of classic Michael Crichton and Stephen King. A thriller with the highest stakes and the most fascinating science, &lt;i&gt;The Colony&lt;/i&gt; does for ants what &lt;i&gt;Jaws &lt;/i&gt;did for sharks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
