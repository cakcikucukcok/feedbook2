  <title>The Dead Lawyer Conspiracy - Jane T. Robe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A SECRET ENTERPRISEAN IRRESISTIBLE IRONY&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Quirky new San Francisco attorney Rachel Ballentine accidentally uncovers a national conspiracy to steal billions of dollars from lawyers. When she suspects the money is funding a covert organization linked to espionage, and political intrigue, she must act.&lt;p&gt;
Rachel is joined by several high-profile senior attorneysher &lt;i&gt;Grey Panthers&lt;/i&gt;. Together they embark on a dangerous search for the stolen funds, and discover the money was funneled into corporations resurrecting the dead. Digging deeper reveals that the scheme reaches into the IRS, the CIA, and possibly the Oval Office.&lt;p&gt;
Despite the danger, the Grey Panthers are determined to leave their legal careers with a bang. Throwing down the gauntlet, they file a lawsuit implicating powerful government officials of illicit activity with a circus-like media spotlight, but those sinister forces do not want the truth exposed. When bribery, theft, and maligning the group fail, Rachel and her Grey Panthers must proceed with caution. The consequences could be deadly." />
