  <title>Points on a Line - D. L. Gentsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Was the financial crisis of 2008 caused by a small group of greedy Wall Street bankersor was there something more sinister at work? Did it begin when free-market politicians gained control of Washington DC, or was it linked to a longer history, starting decadesor even centuries ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Points On A Line narrates an epic tale of manipulation of economic and political events by a secretive group of privileged citizens determined to regain control over the world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jude Anders, the blue-collar kid of a single mom, the journey begins in campus protests of the Vietnam War. Fleeing to Toronto to dodge the draft, he meets eventual lifelong friend Anton Tomasin, an enigmatic young man adopted into wealth and privilege. Their apparently coincidental meeting sets the course of Judes future, dragging him into the heart of American economic policy during the military coups in Chile and Argentina in the 1970s through the complicated chain of events that ultimately brought about the collapse of the world economy in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an advisor to the newly elected President with an intransigent Congress, Jude offers him a chance to reset Americas financial future with a drastic economic elixir called Plan B.&lt;/p&gt;" />
