  <title>Rendezvous in Brussels - Jay Moroney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a time when terrorism is a global threat, it is easy to forget the faces of the individuals caught inside a conflict that exists beyond understanding and continues without the hope of an end. 
For the members of a Palestinian terrorist gang and their opponents in the Israeli Mossad, such an intellectual distance from the true costs of conflict would be a blessing. For them, its all too real, too present, and too personal. For them, its a literal fight to the death. 
Both sides are led by ruthless killers, and both have become numb to the violence they inflict and endure. The Palestinians are intent on killing key members of the Israeli Mossad, including Milledufleur Rose, currently serving as a visiting professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Brussels, and Kim David, the Mossad second in command. 
Milledufleur must call on each of his skills and experience to keep the bloodshed contained. 
Jay Moroney, a retired global business executive, delivers a provocative intrigue that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Milledufleur Rose and Kim David return as characters of the Mossad in their life and death struggle with a Palestinian terror organization. The story takes the reader from Brussels to Kuwait/Saudi Arabia through Poland and back to Brussels where the final confrontation takes place. A real thriller, be ready to be engrossed.
