When a big deal suddenly falls through and Douglas learns that Kelso has been murdered, however, he finds himself in the midst of a homicide investigation where he soon discovers that Kelso is really his former fiance, Maria Ladillya. When he finds out why Maria contacted him after all those years, Douglas must rely on his instinctsand fateas he is unwittingly pulled into an illegal, international operation that exposes lies, revenge, and cover-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this espionage thriller, a broadcasting executive who is about to face loss like never before is consoled by a mysterious woman who encourages him to take a brave journey through his past, present, and future as he questions his true destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
