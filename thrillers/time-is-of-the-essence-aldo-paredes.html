  <title>Time Is of the Essence - Aldo Paredes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The World is recovering from the First Great War and trying
to avert the second one. The Great Depression is still setting
economic terms around the world and it will be the catalyst to
set the world ablaze again.&lt;p&gt;
The year is 1931 New York City - the greatest city in the world.
It will become the epicenter to a struggle that could plunge the
world into darkness and anarchy forever, if evil was to 
prevail.&lt;p&gt;
When humanity needed it the least, out of the pages of history
appears its greatest enemy with evil intentions. This, evil
incarnate controls the minds of all those he deems necessary to
carry out his will. He has manipulated history to tip the scales
of human development his way. He will either rule humanity
or completely destroy it.&lt;p&gt;
Humanities arch-nemesis is now in New York City, to ensure that 
the only person that
can stop him is dead along with his small band of unknown 
heroes. This struggle will
take you through histories most exciting and powerful moments, 
in order to stop the
Devil, the Vatican and Hitler.&lt;p&gt;
Aldric, an incredibly intelligent being and Victoria his centuries old 
protector must risk
it all to save humanity from complete annihilation - from the Devil 
and from a universal
tribunal. In so doing they will rely on some extraordinary 
humans, as well as some infamous
ones  Nikola Tesla and Big Pauly Castellano.&lt;p&gt;
Several bombs are set to go off around the city. Time is running 
out for; the world, New
York City and our heroes. Clock is ticking and Time Is Of the 
ESSENCE.&lt;p&gt;
Aldo Paredes was born in Havana, Cuba and immigrated to the 
United States in 1967
along with his parents and sister but leaving behind his older 
brother - who the communistic
government of Cuba declared ineligible due to his age - 14 1/2 
years old.&lt;p&gt;
Aldo Paredes has acquired more than 20 years of diversified 
design and construction management
experience, with a successful record of achievements in a wide 
range of projects,
including; land development, hospitals, airports, schools, 
restaurants and residential developments.&lt;p&gt;
In the last 5 to 10 years, he has acquired an expertise in Green 
design with wide ranging
applications. A future personal project, which he is currently 
researching and designing
is; to create a proto-typical green house that incorporates a 
minimum of 90% green design
features; from the exterior shell, countertops, fi nishes, power 
generation, greywater
recycling, black water composting, rainwater harvesting and a 
fully landscaped yard with
edible and drought resistant plants.&lt;p&gt;" />
