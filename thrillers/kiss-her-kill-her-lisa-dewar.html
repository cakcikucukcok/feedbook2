  <title>Kiss Her, Kill Her - Lisa Dewar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THE PREDATOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City has a monster on the loose and his name is Tarryn Cooper Love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one had given a second glance to the handsome taxi driver, but in reality he had been molded to be a killer since early childhood.  His mother, who valued a juicy murder above all else, had taught him well.  Just one more trophy and he is set to reach his goal, surpassing his mothers idol, the infamous Ted Bundy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE PREY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a beautiful young woman gets into his cab flashing a wad of cash, he thinks hes hit the jackpot.  As she starts confessing her plans for ending her own life he decides to listen to her story, hoping to charm her back from the brink of death, to heighten his game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he discovers is a twisted tale that has taken her from the hardened streets of LA to the upper crust of New Yorka story that might even rival his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarryn has to decide within the space of 24 hours, if he should kill her or save her  and perhaps save himself in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
