  <title>Now and in the Hour of Our Death - Patrick Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patrick Taylor&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Now and in the Hour of Our Death&lt;/i&gt;  is a moving and compelling portrait of ordinary men and women caught up  in a conflict not of their making, and of the way the past holds onto us even as we try to move on into an uncertain future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine years ago, the bloody conflict in Northern Ireland tore apart two young lovers, consuming their hopes and dreams and changing their lives forever. Now, in 1983, Davy McCutcheon and Fiona Kavanagh find themselves worlds apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Davy, once a bomb-maker for the Provisional IRA, is serving a twenty-five-year sentence in a British prison. Having seen enough of death and violence, he wants nothing more to do with the struggle that cost him his freedom and his love. But old loyalties die hard and, despite himself, Davy is drawn into a dangerous conspiracy on behalf of his fellow Provos . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Fiona has forged a new life for herself in Vancouver, British Columbia, far away from the war-torn streets of Belfast. Now a vice-principal at a local elementary school, she has a successful career, good friends, and a new man in her life. Yet she remains haunted by painful memories of her troubled homeland--and the love she left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
