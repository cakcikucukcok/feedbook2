  <title>Clinical Trial - April Christofferson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The deadly hantavirus has killed hundreds of Native Americans, so when a reputable pharmaceutical company claims to have developed a vaccine against the deadly disease, it should be good news. But when ImmuVac asks Dr. Isabel McLain to conduct a clinical trial of the vaccine on the Blackfeet reservation in Browning, Montana, the proposal gets a distinctly mixed response from both her and the suspicious Blackfeet.  Is the new drug truly safe, or are the Blackfeet being used as human guinea pigs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indian activist Monty Four Bear fears the worst, but Dr. McLain stakes her reputation on the trial&#39;s safety.  Having taken over the poorly-funded reservation clinic after the catastrophic failure of her marriage, Isabel has fought a long, hard struggle to gain the trust of the wary Blackfeet residents of the reservation.  She knows she risks everything she&#39;s accomplished by endorsing ImmuVac&#39;s clinical trial, but she&#39;s willing to take that chance if it means developing a weapon against the hantavirus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when corporate greed makes for questionable science, whom can Isabel truly trust with her life and her career --and the lives of the Blackfeet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
