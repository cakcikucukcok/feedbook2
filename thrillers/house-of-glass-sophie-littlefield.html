  <title>House of Glass - Sophie Littlefield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Bestselling author Sophie Littlefield delivers a riveting, ripped-from-the-headlines story about a family put to the ultimate test&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jen Glass has worked hard to achieve the ideal life: a successful career, a beautiful home in an affluent suburb of Minneapolis, a seemingly perfect family. But inside the Glass house, everything is spinning out of Jen&#39;s control. Her marriage to her husband, Ted, is on the brink of collapse; her fifteen-year-old daughter grows more distant each day; and her five-year-old son barely speaks a word. Jen is on the verge of breaking, but nothing could have prepared her for what is to come….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On an evening that was supposed to be like any other, two men force their way into the Glasses’ home, but what begins as a common robbery takes an even more terrifying turn. Held hostage in the basement for more than forty-eight hours, Jen and Ted must put aside their differences if they are to have any hope of survival. They will stop at nothing to keep their family safe—even if it means risking their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A taut and emotional tale of a family brought together by extraordinary forces, &lt;em&gt;House of Glass&lt;/em&gt; is a harrowing exploration of both the lengths a mother will go to protect her children, and the power of tragedy to teach us what truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;
