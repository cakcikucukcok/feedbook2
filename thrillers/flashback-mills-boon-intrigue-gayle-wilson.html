  <title>Flashback (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Gayle Wilson</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A wounded warrior was facing the toughest mission of his life&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The battlefield had taught Jake Underwood just how much could be lost in a single moment. So when he returned home, scarred and grieving for those he&#39;d left behind, the last thing he needed was to be responsible for another person&#39;s life. Especially that of a missing little girl. But one look in police chief Eden Reddick&#39;s tear-fi lled eyes and Jake couldn&#39;t help but feel her frustration…and share her pain. Jake knew Eden was grateful for whatever investigative skills he could offer– until he uncovered a connection to her mysterious past. Now, as a heartbreaking case turned even more personal when Eden became a target, Jake realized that all he&#39;d lost in his past was nothing compared with just how much he had to lose now…&lt;/p&gt;
