  <title>Her Cowboy Distraction (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Romantic Suspense) (Cowboy Café, Book 1) - Carla Cassidy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d been watching the handsome rancher for a while, just a lone cowboy eating pie with an empty chair beside him. One night, Lizzie Wiles, Cowboy Café&#39;s feisty new waitress, went over and dared to interrupt his tortured solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Daniel Jefferson seemed shocked by her boldness as he buried himself in guilt over his wife&#39;s mysterious death. Lizzie tried to penetrate his gloom, but in the end, found herself falling in love. Having plans to leave town, she didn&#39;t want to think of these consequences. Worse, someone &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted her to disappear–now! Attacked and warned to leave, Lizzie had every reason to go…but she had one undeniable reason to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
