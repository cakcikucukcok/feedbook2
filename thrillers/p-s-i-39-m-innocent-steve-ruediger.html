&lt;p&gt;One night while researching sea turtles on the beach, Lizzie sees illegal aliens being brought ashore by a smuggler. Her accidental observation leads to her being threatened and stalked by the smuggler until he suddenly shows up dead in her apartment, and Lizzie is wanted for his murder. With the help of a semi-retired Ma?a don named Joey, Lizzie tries to uncover evidence to clear her name.

In spite of Joeys help, Lizzie becomes a prisoner on the slave labor farm, where a forced marriage is planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursued by the police and men that want to kill her, Lizzie is running out of time. Will Lizzie ?nd the strength and courage to ?ght her way free and prove her innocence?&lt;/p&gt;" />
