  <title>Doctored Images - Robert Sherrier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Move over Robin Cook! Robert Sherrier has taken the medical thriller to new heights! A brutal Mexican cartel, a dying drug mule, and a radiologist who finds himself hopelessly out of his depth. &lt;i&gt;Doctored Images&lt;/i&gt; has all the punch of a Greg Iles mystery and a protagonist in Dr. Bo Richards who makes Kay Scarpetta look like she slept through med school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Michael McBride, author of Burial Ground and Snowblind &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murder, mayhem and torture collide at warp speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Gil Brogdon, M.D., Editor of Brogdons Forensic Radiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bo Richards is having a very bad week. He gets fired from his residency job, he discovers that his girlfriends death may not have been an accident, and now the Mexican mafia wants him dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Colorado radiology resident is a hero when he saves the life of a drug mule dying in the emergency room with a leaky cocaine packet. But after he uncovers a drug smuggling conspiracy at his prestigious teaching hospital, he becomes a target of the smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still grieving the hit and run death of his girlfriend, Cory, Bo goes to the accident scene on the one-year anniversary of his loss. There he meets Lisa Folletti, an off duty Boulder policewoman and the last person to see Cory alive. With her help and clues from the hit-and-run drivers CAT scan and Corys autopsy X-rays, Bo suspects that Cory was murdered. During a final confrontation with the Mexican mafia leader in the MRI suite, Bo will learn the surprising truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
