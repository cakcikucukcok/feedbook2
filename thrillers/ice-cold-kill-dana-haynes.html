  <title>Ice Cold Kill - Dana Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Grabs you on page one and doesn&#39;t let you go until the final page!&quot; --Nelson DeMille on &lt;i&gt;Crashers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daria Gibron is a woman with a deadly past and an uncertain future. A former Shin-Bet agent now in exile in the U.S. and under the protection of the F.B.I., she works primarily as an interpreter. But Daria is a thrill junkie who can&#39;t resist the occasional freelance job as an operative--a habit that has left her with a trail of corpses behind her, and a few still living, very dangerous, high-powered enemies who would stop at nothing to get revenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En route to an impromptu meeting with an old contact from her days in the Israeli Secret Service, Daria gets an unexpected and anonymous tipoff that she&#39;s about to walk into an ambush. Unsure who is after her, or why, she slips away from her followers and soon learns that she&#39;s been set up--and set up good. Someone has linked her to a much sought-after terrorist, and now all the resources of the U.S. intelligence community are being marshaled against her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she tries to escape the ever-tightening snare laid out for her, someone else is using the operation against her as a distraction to hijack a very dangerous, highly guarded shipment. Now the only person who can keep this shipment from falling into terrorist hands is the one person they chose to set up as a diversion. Daria Gibron is many things--trigger-happy, resourceful, focused, and extremely dangerous --but the one thing she isn&#39;t is anybody&#39;s fool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ice Cold Kill &lt;/i&gt;is an espionage spy thriller from Dana Haynes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
