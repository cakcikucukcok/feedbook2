  <title>Don&#39;t Tell a Soul - David Rosenfelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tim Wallace&#39;s wife died in a boating accident several months ago. Tim was the only eye witness, and one New Jersey cop is sure he killed her. He didn&#39;t, but even if the police eventually clear his name, he&#39;ll never get over this terrible tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On New Year&#39;s Eve, his two best friends and business partners finally convince him to go out for the first time since Maggie&#39;s death, and at their neighborhood pub just a few minutes before midnight, things in Tim Wallace&#39;s life go from bad to worse. &quot;Can you keep a secret? A really big one?&quot; a drunken stranger asks him. Before Tim can say anything or turn away, the man confesses to a months-old murder, even offering as proof the location of the woman&#39;s body. &quot;Now it&#39;s your problem,&quot; he says and walks away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man turns out to have been telling the truth, Tim&#39;s life and work are put under the microscope again by the cops, and this time they&#39;re not giving up. But neither is Tim, even when things keep getting worse for him, and eventually he realizes he&#39;s the only person who can figure out what&#39;s really going on---even if it kills him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Rosenfelt, popular author of six Andy Carpenter mysteries, including the recent hit &lt;i&gt;Play Dead&lt;/i&gt;, delivers his first standalone with &lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t Tell a Soul&lt;/i&gt;, combining the suspense and great characters of his mystery series with an unputdownable, thrilling read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
