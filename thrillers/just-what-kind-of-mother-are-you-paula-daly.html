  <title>Just What Kind of Mother Are You? - Paula Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Lisa Kallisto&amp;#151;overwhelmed working mother&amp;#151;is the not-so-perfect model of the modern woman. She holds down a busy job running an animal shelter, she cares for three demanding children, and she worries that her marriage isn&amp;#8217;t getting enough attention. During an impossibly hectic week, Lisa takes her eye off the ball for a moment and her world descends into a living nightmare. Not only is her best friend&amp;#8217;s thirteen-year-old daughter missing, but it&amp;#8217;s Lisa&amp;#8217;s fault. To make matters worse, Lucinda is the second teenage girl to disappear within the past two weeks. The first one turned up stripped bare and abandoned on the main street after a horrible ordeal. Wracked with guilt over her mistake, and after having been publicly blamed by Lucinda&amp;#8217;s family, Lisa sets out to right the wrong. As she begins digging under the surface, Lisa learns that everything is not quite what it first appears to be.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Paula Daly&amp;#8217;s heart-stopping debut novel, motherhood, marriage, and friendship are tested when a string of abductions tear through a small-town community. Gripping and fast-paced, &lt;I&gt;Just What Kind of Mother Are You?&lt;/I&gt; introduces an outstanding new thriller writer with a terrifying imagination for the horrors that lurk in everyday lives.&lt;/div&gt;" />
