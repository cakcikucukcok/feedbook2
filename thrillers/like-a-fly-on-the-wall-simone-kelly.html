  <title>Like a Fly on the Wall - Simone Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From talented debut author Simone Kelly comes this suspenseful novel that crackles with intrigue, sex, and plenty of surprises&amp;#8212;perfect for fans of&amp;#160;Eric Jerome Dickey&amp;#160;and Carl Weber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Jacques Berradi. Moroccan-born and Manhattan-raised, his genuine, sexy-smooth allure goes hand in hand with a unique gift. Since Jacques was young, he has had the ability to read peoples&amp;#8217; energies, communicate with spirit guides, and even catch glimpses of people&amp;#8217;s futures. Now a professional &amp;#8220;intuitive counselor,&amp;#8221; Jacques&amp;#8217;s clients pay him handsomely for his insight. Unfortunately, Jacques&amp;#8217;s psychic abilities don&amp;#8217;t come with an off switch to tune out the world&amp;#8217;s noise, nor do they always provide him with easy answers; recently Jacques has begun having dark, alarming dreams about his beloved father, a Moroccan immigrant who died when he was a boy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet Kylie Collins, an adventurous, Miami twentysomething who is trying to find her footing after being laid off from a cushy music industry job. When a mishap brings them together, Kylie is instantly mesmerized by Jacques&amp;#8217;s cool demeanor and intuitive abilities, and he&amp;#8217;s captivated by her outgoing charm and breezy good looks. Seeking to learn more about her family history&amp;#8212;including the identity of the father she&amp;#8217;s never known&amp;#8212;Kylie visits Jacques&amp;#8217;s office to gain some insight about her future, and about her free-spirited and headstrong Jamaican mother, True. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But on the night that they meet, a rolling blackout cuts off power throughout Miami. Kylie and Jacques, and a few of his clients, head to the only place in the neighborhood with enough light to see: Like a Fly on the Wall Detective Agency. There, Kylie serendipitously lands herself the perfect new job as an apprentice private eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As partners, Jacques and Kylie are an unstoppable duo. Can Jacques&amp;#8217;s intuition reveal the scandalous history of Kylie&amp;#8217;s mother and father? Will Kylie&amp;#8217;s newfound detective skills uncover evidence about the death of Jacques&amp;#8217;s father? And will the chemistry that charges their friendship bubble over into something much, much hotter&amp;#8230;? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
