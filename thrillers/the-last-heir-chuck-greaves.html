  <title>The Last Heir - Chuck Greaves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Philippe Giroux, estimable patriarch of the Château Giroux wine empire, has tragically lost a son. Or has he? Once confirmed by the court, Alain Giroux&#39;s death will pave the way for his brother Phil to inherit America&#39;s most storied winery. Or will it? Andy Clarkson, Alain&#39;s boyhood chum, covets the Château Giroux vineyard acreage for his neighboring golf resort. Or does he? Claudia Giroux, Philippe&#39;s hauntingly beautiful daughter, has proof that Alain&#39;s death may not have been all that it seems. Or does she?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scions of a privileged California wine dynasty grapple for control of their family&#39;s legacy, attorney Jack MacTaggart is caught in a cross fire of estrangement, betrayal, and murder. To complicate matters, Jack is being shadowed by film star Ethan Scott, who hopes to spin the dross of a family&#39;s private travails into box-office gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the stately oaks and sylvan vineyards of California&#39;s fabled Napa Valley, Jack learns the hard way that while blood may be thicker than water, money is a powerful anticoagulant. As the long-buried secrets of a troubled family are finally revealed, only one question remains to be answered: Who will survive to become the Last Heir?&lt;/p&gt;" />
