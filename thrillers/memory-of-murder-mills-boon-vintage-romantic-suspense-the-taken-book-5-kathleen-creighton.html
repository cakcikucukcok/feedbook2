  <title>Memory Of Murder (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Romantic Suspense) (The Taken, Book 5) - Kathleen Creighton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;Is my father a murderer?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Caring for a mother with Alzheimer&#39;s was heartbreaking enough for Lindsey Merrill. But when her mother made bizarre but adamant claims that Lindsey&#39;s loving father was a killer, it was too much to bear. So she turned to detective Alan Cameron for guidance. Before long, the single dad&#39;s soothing reassurances morphed into a smoldering attraction….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Evidence quickly mounted that all was not as it seemed in the Merrill family. As a professional, Alan was obliged to pursue the case–as a man, he had to shield this special woman from pain. Would his shocking discovery break her heart just as he was making it his very own?&lt;/p&gt;
