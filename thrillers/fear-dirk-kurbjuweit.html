As the Tiefenthalers settle into their home, they becoming increasingly disturbed as Dieter&amp;#8217;s strange behavior turns malevolent.

Finally, Randolph admits his of own feelings of desperation and helplessness, which ultimately led to his father&amp;#8217;s intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Randolph plumbs the depths of his own uncertainty surrounding the murder&amp;#8212;pondering fundamental questions about masculinity, violence, and the rule of law&amp;#8212;his reliability is slowly but irrevocably called into doubt. The result is an unsettling meditation on middle-class privilege and &quot;civilized life&quot; that builds to a shocking conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
