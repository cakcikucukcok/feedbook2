  <title>The 2012 Black Hole Killer™ - Arthur T. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 2012 Black Hole Killer  is a cross-genre murder-mystery/cosmological Bonfire of the Vanities novel about the predicted universe&#39;s end on December 21, 2012. The book begins with a seeming murder that occurs on July 28, 1977. The victim is floating in mid-air and frozen to the coldest temperature of the universe, absolute zero, when it&#39;s 95 degrees outside. The book then takes you to what happened the day before and next to the day after the body is discovered.&lt;p&gt; 
The plot centers around the travails of the Hindu Goddess Kali. Fourteen billion years old, She possesses all the powers of the black hole which birthed Her in the Big Bang. We then learn that a team consisting of a psychiatrist avatar of the Hindu God Shiva, two members of Kenyan Kikuyu royalty, two New York City detectives, and an astrophysicist Hopi Chief join forces to hunt Her down. &lt;p&gt; 
They confront Her at the summit of the devil volcano Shaitani in Kenya one month later. There they learn that Kali and the universe&#39;s fate are inextricably linked to the Black Stone of Mecca, Jomo Kenyatta&#39;s Burning Spear, a sacred Mayan throat-slitting black sacrificial knife, and Himmler&#39;s Wewlesberg Castle&#39;s occult Black Sun mosaic. After the confrontation, Kali kills two of the six and escapes. &lt;p&gt;
Then, after escaping, Kali between the years 1997 and 2010 links up with a group of corrupt politicians and Wall Streeters with whom She in 1977 had founded the Weather Derivatives Hedge Fund. With its help, She uses Her black hole powers to raise one trillion dollars cash from the natural disasters She creates. She needs this money to build an atom smasher under the Himalayan Mountain K2 which She plans to use on December 21,2012. &lt;p&gt;
The tale concludes by tying cosmological and financial &quot;black holes&quot; and &quot;bubbles&quot; ever more tightly together until Her final confrontation with our psychiatrist avatar at the very moment the universe is scheduled to end." />
