  <title>Cruisin&#39; with Vengeance - Roosevelt Mompremier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rick Solomon sits in the Miami Federal Correctional Institution, and the only thing he can think about is how the audacious Rachel Tolar and her friends falsely pegged him as a rapist. 
When hes set free, hes a different man. Hes been degraded and beaten in prison, and he wants someone to pay. He starts by going after Rachels girlfriends. After seeing what is happening, Rachel boards a cruise ship named &lt;i&gt;Redemption&lt;/i&gt; to escape a deadly confrontation; she has no idea that Rick is waiting for her.
And neither of them knows that Ross Leblanc, a veteran of the Miami Shores Police Department, is also on the ship with his seventeen-year-old daughter, Kim. Rosss co-workers have sent him away on a sabbatical to get some rest and relaxation, and they hope that maybe hell find someone special. They have no idea what waits for him on board.
This will be one vacation that no one forgets. Enjoy a dangerous adventure with a surprising conclusion in &lt;i&gt;Cruisin With Vengeance.&lt;/i&gt;" />
