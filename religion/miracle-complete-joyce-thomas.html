  <title>Miracle Complete - Joyce Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am on a mission to bring awareness, understanding, and a humbling toward those who suffer from all forms of mental illness by exposing psychiatric procedures, where they may be reviewed and changed for the better. My mission includes how important honesty and communication is between us and our psychiatrists, especially when prescription medication is prescribed. I know God created medication for our healing and coping on this Earth. Communication and conversation between family members and the mentally ill patient is important to help conquer and overcome. 
My goal is to share with those who suffer from all forms of mental illness to become compassionate toward and embrace the wonderful gift of life God has given us and others. My own personal choices have been major keys to overcoming and conquering, whereas I have received a confirmed miracle from my bipolar illness. There is hope.
You will understand why I refer to the Holy Bible as the most valuable book on Earth. How important it is to accept Jesus Christ into our lives and live life to the fullest, no matter the obstacles we must conquer. Forgiveness is a gift we must give ourselves to love another and to stop ourselves from making major mistakes. 
Life is valuable not only to us but others. Embrace your life God has given you and look forward to our heavenly home, which we can receive by listening and walking according to the plans God has for everyones life. God forgives." />
