  <title>Christness. - Reverend Tom Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reverand Tom Wright is an associate pastor at the First United Methodist Church in Geneseo, Illinois. He is concerned that believers are missing the essence of Christianity. Most believers feel a separation between themselves and Jesus Christ. Jesus is divine and they are not, so they feel that Jesus is over there and they are over here. As a result, there is no intimacy, no relationship with Christ. With that mindset, modern day Christianity is experiencing a power shortage, limping along in dry intellectualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Wrights book paints a different picture. Believers have a Christnessan intersection where there is no difference between themselves and Christ. Scriptures describing Christness are found in virtually every chapter in the New Testament. Wright challenges believers to use their Christness as Jesus used His.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Christness liberates believers from the practice of passively listening to sermons Sunday after Sunday. They will now become capable of leaving the bleachers, stepping onto the playing field, and getting into the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revolutionary insight of Christness causes Rev. Wright to ask believers to stop making excuses and become what they were created to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is that? you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus describes it in John 14:12; Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to the Father. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Tom Wright is an accomplished speaker for investment and Christian audiences. He has developed a course-of-instruction called Soul Searching which enables students to discover Gods purpose for their lives. This course has been successfully taught in academia prior to his entering the ministry. (For details, see his website: Tomthesoulcoach.com).&lt;/p&gt;" />
