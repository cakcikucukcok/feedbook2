  <title>The Ayahuasca Path - Gerd Fonrobert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains a model of the spiritual path with two foundations: the use of ayahuasca for the effect of mental concentration and for self-knowledge as a spiritual improvement process, reaching purification by knowledge of oneself and the faithful practice of good. There is basic information about ayahuasca and its properties and benefits as well as on the sacred plants used in its preparation. As an illustration, a few reports of extraordinary experiences lived as a result of the communion of ayahuasca as well as stories told by supporters are also included.
The use of ayahuasca propagated here is the entheogenic use (i. e., for the purpose of spiritual evolution, achieved by communion with the sacred), which includes beings belonging to higher planes of existence. Even God or the Supreme Being, how each one is able to imagine it, may be contacted. The subject of spirituality is treated, highlighting the common denominator of all religions, shared also by shamans and syncretic cults. The book describes the expanded state of consciousness achieved through communion of ayahuasca, which includes the enhancement of our intuitive side, allowing the perception of beings and energies that we do not normally have access to and that, on the other hand, strengthens the link between people of a group to give rise to paranormal phenomena, such as telepathy or clairvoyance. It shows the significance of spiritual healing and its reach by ayahuasca. We discuss the similarities of ayahuasca with drugs and establish the difference between them. The theme ayahuasca and health presents the necessary caution regarding interaction of ayahuasca with medicines or drugs and the risk to persons subject to psychotic outbreaks.
In conclusion, it suggests what may be seen in the crystal ball, the future of those who choose the path of ayahuasca." />
