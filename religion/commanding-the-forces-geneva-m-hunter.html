  <title>Commanding the Forces - Geneva M. Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God will use this book, Commanding the Forces, to birth a quest and deep desire for more of him within all that will receive. It will further facilitate the revelation of who you are, why you are, and where you are destined to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, some very pertinent questions are answered such as, what has really been going on in your life? Why have you been under such severe attacks from the enemy? Why are there certain activities or relationships forbidden to you or are outside of your comfort zone? Why are you, now and always, different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All who have been called to the ministry of intercession are not necessarily in the church just yet. The enemy has bombarded you with such fierce attacks that youre not even sure youre a believer right now. The attacks are perpetrated to prevent your coming to God and fulfilling your God-given destiny. Praying saints are very frightful to the enemy, so he will do everything in his power to keep you from knowing who you really are. Commanding the Forces will serve to answer some pertinent questions, reveal hidden biblical secrets, eradicate confusion, and further educate the body of Christ and beyond concerning this often misunderstood ministry!&lt;/p&gt;" />
