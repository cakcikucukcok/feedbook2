  <title>God, Grace, and Gooseberry - Max Brennan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author hopes to entertain you with these 101 short articles. You may laugh (or cry) at the stories about Gooseberry the cat, Max the dog, and a possum that was far too good at playing dead. But all of the articles in this book are essentially about the gospel. They push us to see that God is not just real, but accessible. There are numerous stories about people who have had what William James called business with God. You will read accounts of profound religious experiences, including near-death experiences. There are moving stories of conversion and dramatic accounts of divine intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are articles here about the logic of faith and the relationship between science and religion. You will be told in these pages that faith makes sense and science and religion are ultimately one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a skeptic about God, or if you believe in a do-nothing God far removed from our lives, this book may challenge you. The cumulative impact of these 101 short articles could overwhelm your skepticism. You may come to agree with the author that God is not just realand accessiblebut obviously so.&lt;/p&gt;" />
