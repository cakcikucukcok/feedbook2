  <title>They Have Revelation Absolutely  Wrong - Brother Fred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first title I had for this book was; &quot;GETTING OUT OF HELL&quot;. Because that is one main point we all were taught &amp; still no one Preaches ALL must come out of hell. It&#39;s in Rev. 20:13 and is plainly written. Pastors don&#39;t preach it because they can&#39;t explain the &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; that most go to from Hell. Some of those getting out of hell at the 2nd Resurrection will go to the New Earth. That&#39;s why the Book of Life is open AGAIN at the 2nd Res. Rev 20:15. Then who really burns forever &amp; ever in the Lake of Fire? Again not ALL. Rev 14:9-11 says ONLY those who do 3 specific things will be tormented for ever. All who ever lived on earth who do not do THOSE 3 things will eventually receive the 2nd death after they have paid for all, all, all their sins on earth. Even &quot;idle words&quot;. That&#39;s why the Lake is called the &quot;second death&quot; also. 
Then I got to thinking of all the other things they got wrong that are JUST as important &amp; decided to just call the book &quot;ABSOLUTELY WRONG&quot;. I ask readers to please check this book with any book on Rev by any Denomination or Scholar &amp; compare them with that Holy Spirit that indwells all Christians. I say over &amp; over in this book they must &quot;learn to know His leading &amp; stop believing everything they hear from the pulpit. &quot;If the blind [leaders] lead the blind [followers] BOTH fall into the ditch&quot; [of hell]. There is a New Earth but no Pastor seems to know exactly who gets it. I show you this. 
One last thing is the so called &quot;Tribulation Saints&quot; are NOT anyone who is saved DURING the Tribulation. No one can who did not accept Christ can be saved after the Great Trib starts.They are 2 tribulations anyway. The first we ALL go into. In this book you will know for &quot;sure&quot; who the 2 Witnesses are. Christians can never ask a non Christian who has followed Hindu, Islam etc to check their teaching they have followed 1,000&#39;s of years, when they won&#39;t re-check their denominational one they followed a few 100 years. There are 2 places to spend eternal life. One is in Heaven with a Spiritual body. The other is on the New Earth with a new physical body. You will KNOW who gets which &amp; why. Jesus only Preached Heaven because we all can make Heaven IF we get the Gospel right." />
