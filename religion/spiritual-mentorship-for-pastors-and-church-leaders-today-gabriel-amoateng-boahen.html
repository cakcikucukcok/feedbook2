  <title>Spiritual Mentorship for Pastors and Church Leaders Today - Gabriel Amoateng-Boahen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My timely book seeks to, among others, to appreciate and congratulate all men and women of God in ministry; and also encourage them for their continued dedication in leading the flock under their pastoral care as Chief Shepherds. Bravo! On a more concerned and passionate note, the book seeks to equip the pastor/leader with some basic ministerial skills for sound, fruitful, untiring and ever-lasting soul-impacting ministry, devoid of any abuses either covertly or overtly. My final aim is to challenge the pastor/leader to be professional and current for contemporary ministry because society is becoming more scientific, technological, academic, intellectual, argumentative, and above all, critical, and skeptical. Our local communities are increasingly becoming more violent, confused, frustrated, socially darker and gloomy, stressful, and uncontrollable. The pastoral services of the pastoral/leaders thus become inevitable, crucial, and critical because communities look up to the spiritual leader. Indeed, the pastor/leader is the radiant light of hope, a beacon of light of inspiration, and encouragement to many. The challenge is for all pastors/leaders to lead their respective local communities to greater heights as Gods ambassadors and the Called/Chosen for our present generation, and further work harder to hand over a better holistic legacy to the next generation. The Gospel must be preached in its fullest entirety uncompromisingly in season and out of season, devoid of any excuses. Let the Body of Christ be more united than ever to build a New Church that is modeled after the life of Christ. The Church that is anointed and empowered with answers to address the multiple-problems and the myriad of challenges facing the 21st century and beyond." />
