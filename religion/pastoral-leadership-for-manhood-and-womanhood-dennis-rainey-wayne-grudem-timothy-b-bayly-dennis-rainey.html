  <title>Pastoral Leadership for Manhood and Womanhood - Dennis Rainey, Wayne Grudem, Timothy B. Bayly, Dennis Rainey...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the shepherd of the flock, a pastor has many responsibilities&amp;ndash;few as great as leading and training families. The pervasive attitude and beliefs of the world have only added stress and confusion to this task. Sixteen highly regarded men and women help bring clarity and guidance to this important issue. They tackle practical topics such as how and why to preach on biblical manhood and womanhood, putting the Internet to use, church discipline, small groups, and handling domestic violence. They discuss the personal applications within the pastor&#39;s marriage, and they examine the biblical views of ministering to singles, homosexuality, leadership and submission, and much more. This compilation is thorough, potent, and a must-have for any pastor&#39;s library.&lt;/p&gt;" />
