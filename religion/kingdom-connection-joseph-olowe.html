  <title>Kingdom Connection - Joseph Olowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christianity is not a religion; it is an introduction into a new way of life &amp;mdash; into a new KINGDOM with principles that keep the members of the Kingdom to continually enjoy the dividends of their membership. Unfortunately, while many are coming into the kingdom having submitted their lives to the lordship and infinite love of Jesus &amp;mdash; the King of kings &amp;mdash; many of such people never get rooted in the basic principles of the kingdom. As a result, many others have returned to their old lives because their new experience of the Christian faith did not align with their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if new Christians can be equipped with the knowledge that gets them rooted in this Kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy? What if not-so-new Christians can master these basic Christian principles and teach them to those that are coming to the faith having experienced the goodness of this new life indeed? It is to this end that Dr. Joseph Olowe has put together this book, Kingdom Connection, to bridge this gap of ignorance of Kingdom principles amongst believers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is his hope that all that reads this book will be equipped unto fruitfulness and empowered to go into the world, declaring &amp;lsquo;Come and taste and see that the Lord is good!&amp;rsquo; May the book be a blessing to you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
