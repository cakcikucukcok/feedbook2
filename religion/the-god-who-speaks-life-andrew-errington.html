  <title>The God Who Speaks Life - Andrew Errington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who is the God of the Bible, and what does it mean to have faith in him? This book aims to answer these questions in ten, short chapters, five of which introduce God, and five of which explain the core aspects of the Christian faith. It aims to go to the heart of the issues without taking too long about it. God, we learn, is the God who is Creator, Judge, Saviour, Life-Giver, and Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything about the Christian faith flows out of that reality. Each discussion revolves around key Bible passages, accompanied by questions for reflection. It is a compact, elegant introduction for anyone&lt;br /&gt;
seeking to understand the Christian faith more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Errington grew up in New South Wales, where he learnt to love the sea, rock cakes, and Jesus. He and his&lt;br /&gt;
family have lived in Sydney&amp;rsquo;s inner west, and in Aberdeen, Scotland, where they learnt to love walking in the woods in the freezing cold, and where Andrew studied for his doctorate in Christian ethics. This book grew out of the wonderful friendships and conversations that filled Andrew&amp;rsquo;s time as a minister of Newtown and Erskineville Anglican Church, in Sydney.&lt;br /&gt;
