  <title>The Image of the Invisible - Connie J. Cartisano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Lucifer had it allbrains, beauty, position. What the hell happened? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For that matter, what did the angels think their king was doing when he created the heavens and the earth? Putting together a new kind of being, thats what. In a unique living exhibit: a three-dimensional universe of time and space. And thats where the trouble began. Had the king left well enough alone, as Lucifer was fond of saying, things might have turned out differently. But then, the king of heaven was never one for leaving things alone. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Image of the Invisible opens as the king prepares to unveil his new creation in the Museum of Natural History. As First Thinker, Lucifer alone foresees danger to the realm if the king succeeds in bringing the inferior specimens out of the museum. Why is the king so besotted, so reckless? Worse, the king repeatedly ignores kingdom principles in dealing with these creatures. Is he still fit to reign? As Lucifers doubt escalates, he dreams of a terrifying and cunning alter ego, the Satan, who conspires to take over the kings city. Torn between his devotion to the king and his concern for the city, Lucifer must choose. Can he make the ultimate sacrifice to save the kingdom he loves?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
