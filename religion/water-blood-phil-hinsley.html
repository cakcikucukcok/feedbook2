  <title>Water &amp; Blood - Phil Hinsley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What did he say?
He made himself equal with God!
This blasphemer must die!
There were many who heard what he said and stopped following him because his teaching was offensive to them. Today many do not know what he actually said and often his words are ignored or misrepresented.
The history of the church is one of divisions over what he taught and many counterfeit accounts of his teaching have gained acceptance.
This account will surprise and perhaps even shock many.
What did he look like?
What did he teach about heaven and hell?
What happens to us when we die?
What day did he die on?
What caused his death?
What day did he rise from the dead?
Why will he return?
What was his message in one short sentence?
We have got it all wrong" />
