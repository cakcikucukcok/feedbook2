  <title>The Bible in the Hospital - Rev. Doug Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The minister in the hospital setting can build relationships with patients faster than any other member of the health care team.  Patients who have only a brief time with the minister may feel like he is a long-time friend to them.  In some case they may view him as a life-long friend.  I call this fast bonding the temporal life long relationship.
The reason behind this is that the patient sees the minister in the hospital as a link in the life long chain of ministers they have known and loved.  Use this advantage without taking advantage of the patient.
This book is written to minister to those who minister to others.  It is more of a ready reference than a book to be read cover-to-cover in a sitting.  Take advantage of what you need for the moment.  The rest of the book will have use at a latter time." />
