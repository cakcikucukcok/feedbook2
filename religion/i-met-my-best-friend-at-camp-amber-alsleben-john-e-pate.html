  <title>I Met My Best Friend at Camp - Amber Alsleben, John E. Pate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Gabi sees her friends enjoying their summer, while shes expected to work in the family bakery, and has plans to attend Camp Ever Wood, she doesnt anticipate that her summer would turn out to be life-changing. When Gabi attends camp, girls laugh at her, shes continually called by the wrong name, bugs are dumped on her, and much more. Gabis journey to camp is filled with embarrassing obstacles, a few unfriendly campers, and homesickness. When she reaches out to her parents for help, shes met with indifference. Her overworked parents have too much on their minds to help her. 
Gabi faces some challenges such as: unfriendly campers, loneliness, and embarrassing moments. These challenges all lead her to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Gabi anticipates her friends arrival to camp, hoping that Jennifer would cure all of the hurts she feels inside. When she realizes that Jennifer cannot save her, she turns to the One who can, Jesus." />
