  <title>I May Not Know What I&#39;m Talking About but I&#39;m Gonna Say It Anyway - Tara Ratney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wise advice imparted from a street savvy black woman, I May Not Know What Im Talking 
                                   About But Im Gonna Say It Anyway delves into man/woman issues where from time to time 
                    a suggestion or two is thrown in along the way.
                       According to African-American Lifestyle Magazine (www.AA-LIFESTYLE.com), While Tara concedes that she 
                            isn&#39;t an expert in many areas, she can comfortably say that God doesn&#39;t bless mess.   Often sassy and sometimes 
                            crass, she invites readers to recognize themselves or their behaviors.  No one escapes her scathing observations as 
                            she generously heaps blame and shame on enabling parents, disrespectful children, nonexistent morals and marriages 
                            which have no ground rules.                                                                   
                                Blue Ink Review (www.blueinkreview) comments that The author relays fundamental Christian principles, using biblical passages relating to marriage and relationships, but theyre analyzed in a real-world manner, using colorful and somewhat salty language. Its like hearing your favorite aunt tell it like it is. &quot;Dont get too comfortable with the idea that whats between your legs is always going (to) save the day,&quot; Ratney writesRatney advises women that sexual, emotional and financial security are &quot;at the bottom of our motives&quot; in choosing a mate and that there must be consequences for bad behavior in life.  Overall, the book is a must read for anyone seeking to improve decisions and relationships.
