"The largest mass shooting in US history took place at a gay club and the LGBTQ community has been profoundly affected" he began. He then implored his fellow Catholics-and people everywhere-to "stand not only with the people of Orlando but also with their LGBTQ brothers and sisters. . . . Sadly of all the US Catholic bishops who expressed their condolences after the shooting, only one that I know . . . made any explicit reference to the LGBT community." A powerful call for tolerance, acceptance, and support—and a reminder of Jesus' message for us to love one another—Father Martin's post went viral and was viewed more than 1,6 million times.</p><p>Now, Martin expands on his reflections in this moving and inspiring book, offering a powerful, loving, and much-needed voice in a time marked by anger, prejudice, and divisiveness. Adapted from a talk he gave to New Ways Ministry, a group that ministers to and advocates for LGBT Catholics, <em>Building a Bridge</em> provides a roadmap for repairing and strengthening the bonds that unite all of us as God's children.
