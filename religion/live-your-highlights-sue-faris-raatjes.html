&lt;p&gt;All kinds of students make up a classroom. There are eager-beaver over-achievers, reluctant learners, at-riskers, and specially challenged students. There are rebellious ones, emotionally needy ones, and many front-row students. Each brings special challenges and rewards, but the most desirable trait is their teach-ability. Are they willing to learn? Its the same for us. God accepts us and wants to teach us about himself and how to trust him. Are we teachable? No matter what kind of student we are, theres a seat for us. He is the Master Teacher.&lt;/p&gt;" />
