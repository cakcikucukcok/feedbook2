&lt;p&gt;Sin&lt;br /&gt;
The act of violating Gods will or the Bible.&lt;br /&gt;
Genesis 37:320&lt;br /&gt;
Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons, and because of this, his other sons were very jealous of him. They were so jealous they decided to kill him. Israel sent Joseph to check on his brothers. When they saw him coming, they put their plan into action. They put him in a pit and then sold him. They covered his coat with blood, &lt;br /&gt;
took it to their father, and told him Joseph was eaten by a wild animal. &lt;br /&gt;
They sold their brother and lied to their father.&lt;/p&gt;" />
