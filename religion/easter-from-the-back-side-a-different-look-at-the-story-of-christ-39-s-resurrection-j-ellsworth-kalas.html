      <meta name="description" content="Easter from the Back SideJ. Ellsworth KalasUsing an approach similar to the one he took in Parables from the Back Side and other books in the popular Back Side series, author J. Ellsworth Kalas opens up new possibilities of insight into the biblical Easter story. The author looks beyond the traditional gospel scriptures to connect the story of Christ&#39;s resurrection with other stories and scriptures throughout the Bible, including both the Old Testament and the New Testament.Kalas&#39;s creative approach both clarifies basic teachings and introduces new possibilities of meaning, even for those who are most familiar with the Easter story. Enriched with contemporary illustrations and personal experiences, this volume will provide new perspectives on Easter. Chapter titles and Scriptures include: &quot;Why We Need Easter&quot; (Genesis 3:1-7, 22-24); &quot;Easter from an Ash Heap&quot; (Job 19:13-27); &quot;Easter for the Disillusioned&quot; (Ecclesiastes 2:14-26); &quot;Ezekiel Celebrates Easter&quot; (Ezekiel 37:1-10); &quot;Easter Is a Love Story&quot; (John 20:1-18); &quot;Late for Easter&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:1-11); and &quot;Forever Easter&quot; (Revelation 21:1-4). J. ELLSWORTH KALAS is president of Asbury Theological Seminary and has been part of the faculty there since 1993, after thirty-eight years as a United Methodist pastor and five years in evangelism with the World Methodist Council. He has been a presenter on Disciple videos, is the author of the Christian Believer study, and has written more than thirty books, including the popular Back Side series; Longing to Pray: How the Psalms Teach Us to Talk with God; Strong Was Her Faith: Women of the New Testament; and What I Learned When I Was Ten." />
