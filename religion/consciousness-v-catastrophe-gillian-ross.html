  <title>Consciousness V Catastrophe - Gillian Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.&quot; Albert Einstein. 
 The current crises besetting humanity call for a revolution in consciousness and a mystical renaissance that will bring about a whole new story of what it means to be human. To this end, Consciousness v Catastrophe introduces the reader to the new philosophy of Evolutionary Spirituality. It is a philosophy that is engaging visionary scientists, philosophers and spiritual thinkers across the planet. They are forging a new understanding of evolution that honours science, reframes culture and radically updates spirituality. 
Evolutionary Spirituality celebrates the realization that the creative energy, that has driven the evolution of the universe for billions of years, is now becoming conscious of itself through us. It sees consciousness, not matter, as centre stage in the mystery that is evolution and reconnects us to the sacred dimension of existence. Above all, it helps to liberate us from the contracting concerns of ego, inspiring us to awaken our mystical and creative potential, and serve the bigger picture with humility, gratitude and a profound sense of our unique purpose. 
 The first half of the book looks at the Big Picture of evolution- physical and cultural - and brings the reader into the revolutionary implications of seeing human consciousness as the emerging driving force of evolution replacing natural selection. 
The second half explores the new story of Evolutionary Spirituality, including its compatibility with contemporary scientific knowledge and the possibilities for consciousness that can be gleaned from the spiritual wisdom of mystics from all times and traditions. 
 With the help of profound quotations and website references, the book aims to inspire the reader to explore the teachings of many of the most prominent evolutionaries who, in their writings and in online conversations and courses, are promoting the consciousness revolution across the planet." />
