  <title>The Recent Unpleasantness: Calvary Church&#39;s Role in the Preservation of the Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Pittsburgh - Harold T. Lewis, Mark Hollingsworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the wake of the 2003 General Convention approval of the consecration of Gene Robinson, an openly gay and partnered man, to be a bishop, the Convention of the Diocese of Pittsburgh took steps to secede from the Episcopal Church. When it became clear that by rewriting and reinterpreting the canons, the Diocese deemed itself entitled to the assets of the Diocese, the Rector and Vestry of Calvary Church, Pittsburgh, took the unprecedented, and as it turned out, successful action of challenging these actions in civil court, by suing the bishop and other officers of the Diocese. The Recent Unpleasantness tells the story of the circumstances in church and society that long predated Robinson&#39;s election, which set the stage for these developments, and discusses the ramifications of the lawsuit in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, the Episcopal Church, and throughout the Anglican Communion. It is an intriguing tale of the interface of bishops and archbishops, prelates and primates, synods and standing committees, and addresses issues surrounding the challenges and costs of rebuilding a church &quot;by schisms, rent asunder, by heresies distressed.&quot;" />
