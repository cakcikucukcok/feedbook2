  <title>They Came to Kill Me - Dorothy A. Weatherford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the spiritual warfare I have encountered in my life.   When God first raised me up as a minister and then a Pastor, I had a lot of zeal faith and fervor.   I had no idea or thoughts about the hierarchy of Satan.   I thought everyone in the church were people of God and loved God.   I was totally ignorant to the devices of Satan.   Through the warfare I experienced from Satan, I went from being a person of zeal, faith and fervor to despondency, fear and hopelessness.   At one point I believed I was cursed and a curse to other people because of the intensity of the warfare I was experiencing.    That all of the warfare I experienced, I know God allowed it so I would know first-hand the intentions of the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known to the church Eph 3:10.   It is not until we know and understand the course of action, process, purpose and strategy Satan follows that we can combat and overthrow his devices.   We must have the Wisdom of God to defeat the powers of darkness as stated in Eph 3:10 to have the (manifold) or many sided Wisdom of God. 
This book is to enlighten the body of Christ and teach them about the weapons of our warfare.   Because if we do not know how to properly use our weapons and know what weapons are that Satan uses against us we will always live a defeated life.   We must understand that our weapons are mightier than Satan (II Cor.  10:4).   But we must properly utilize the weapons of the Lord to disarm the weapons of Satan.   Pray and ask God to show you how to walk in his wisdom, armour and power by his Spirit to defeat the strategies and intentions of Satan.   It is my purpose in the book to expose the weapons that God has revealed unto me of the enemy.   Howe he came to destroy me, my church and my home.   I have lived through these horrific attacks in these three areas of my life.   In John 10:10 the thief comes to steal, kill and destroy.   I can truly attest to these facts that they came to do just that.   Now the time for the body of Christ to see and understand that Christ came that we might have life, that we might have life more abundantly and thats what we are going to have because of the knowledge that is going to be revealed through Christ to his people (Hosea 4:6).   We will no longer be destroyed because knowledge that is being revealed to his sons and daughters of God." />
