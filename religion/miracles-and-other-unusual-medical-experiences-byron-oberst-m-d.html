  <title>Miracles and Other Unusual Medical Experiences - Byron Oberst M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book describes the many diverse experiences of a very active pediatrician from 1943 to 1988. This story begins when he was in medical school in 1943 and ends with his retirement thirty-seven years later in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes post retirement stints as a Medical Director for a medical software company and being the Medical Director for a commercial plasma collecting center. He vividly describes many different and unusual medical cases including two true Miracles. One occurred in 1952 during the horrendous polio epidemic, Connie and the other one in the 1970s, Thumbelina. These Miracles are described vivid detail with all of their agonizing twists and turns. Neither patient should have survived with their many complications and circumstances, but with Gods grace they did. This book contains unusual and different exotic medical encounters when the author was in Japan while in the Army Medical Corps in 1949-1950. This book details why and how he had to become a pseudo-specialist in several fields in his early and middle practice years. There were few, if any, trained specialists during those early years. Dr. Oberst portrays a full and productive professional life in many ways which are described in this tome. This book is a pleasant and interesting read for everyone to enjoy. It contains humor, vivid descriptions, happiness, agonies, and pathos.&lt;/p&gt;" />
