  <title>Aged to Perfection - Marianne Smalling Thurston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Marianne Thurston was holding her grandfathers hand as the final breath of air trickled from his lungs. What she experienced was overwhelming, intriguing, and somehow curiously calming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whirlwind of emotions, memories, questions and curiosities stormed her thoughts. Time seemed to stop and yet rush ahead. As she tried to decipher the moment, Scripture started surfacing in her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to ease her pain, she began reading and searching through her Bible. Seated at the keys, recording her findings, she used &lt;em&gt;Aged to Perfection&lt;/em&gt; as a source of peace and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you truly love studying the Word of God and have lost a friend or loved one, you will find comfort in the multitude of verses proclaiming the sovereignty of God. The life of a man, the death of a maneverything that takes place between his birth and his graveis according to the divine purpose of God. Life, even a one hundred-year-old life, is but a vapor. Jehovah God is, was, and forever shall be sovereign.&lt;/p&gt;" />
