  <title>Tampering with the Order of God - Dr. Jessie M. Knox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A challenge for the Church. &lt;br /&gt;Are we really in order with Gods Word?&lt;br /&gt;My son, pay attention to my wisdom; listen carefully to my wise counsel. Then you will show discernment, and your lips will express what youve learned. For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. For she cares nothing about the path to life. She staggers down a crooked trail and doesnt realize it. So now, my sons, listen to me. Never stray from what Im about to say: Stay away from her! Dont go near the door of her house! Proverbs 5:1-8, NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are YOU at deception&#39;s door? Or is the Independent Spirit at your door? Find out in the pages of Tampering with the Order of God: Dancing with Deception.&lt;/p&gt;" />
