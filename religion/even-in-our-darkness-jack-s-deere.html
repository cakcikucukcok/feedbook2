  <title>Even in Our Darkness - Jack S. Deere</title>

In his mid-twenties, Jack would rise to fame and success as a leading scholar, popular speaker, and bestselling author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite being rescued and exalted, Jack would ultimately be crushed in the years that followed. He would lose his son to suicide and his wife to alcoholism. Only then would Jack wrestle with his own addictions, surrender control, and experience true healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An authentic story of the Christian life,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Even in Our Darkness&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;will serve as your own guide in overcoming life&amp;rsquo;s disappointments and learning to hear God speak in unbelievable ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jack Deere speaks on a vulnerable, raw, and honest level about his own narrative and the darkness he has encountered, both around him and within his own soul. He ultimately points the reader to the God who is always there and who always sustains.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;mdash;Dr. John Townsend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Written beautifully and harrowingly&amp;mdash;and so grippingly that you won&amp;rsquo;t want to stop reading&amp;mdash;this story is everyone&amp;rsquo;s story.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;mdash;Eric Metaxas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Raw, gritty, and transparent, Jack&amp;rsquo;s writing rings with effervescent joy and searing pain. I read the last seventy-five pages with my heart in my throat and tears in my eyes. If I could, I&amp;rsquo;d send every person reading this a copy myself. It&amp;rsquo;s that good.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;mdash;Lynn Vincent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
