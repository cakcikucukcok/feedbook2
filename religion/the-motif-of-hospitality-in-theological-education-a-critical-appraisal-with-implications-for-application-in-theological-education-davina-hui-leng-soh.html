  <title>The Motif of Hospitality in Theological Education: A Critical Appraisal with Implications for Application in Theological Education - Davina Hui Leng Soh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These are exciting times in theological education as old models are being reassessed and teachers and schools are looking for guidance on how best to do the job and how to profitably relate to students in the ministry of teaching. Increasingly, the motif of hospitality is being used to guide our thinking and practice, but it needs a careful assessment if it is to be of maximum use to theological education today.  This book provides an integrated biblical, theological, and educational rationale to inform theological educators of the place of hospitality in enhancing their quest to create more effective learning environments for the holistic formation of students. Dr Davina Soh explores key elements of hospitality such as inclusion, presence, care, and reciprocity, which when combined, can deliver the best possible educational experience for theological students and transform an entire institution." />
