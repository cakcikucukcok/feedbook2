  <title>Roses Will Bloom Again - Frances Holder Eastridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Frances Eastridge was raised poor near the end of the depression on a tobacco farm, with two of the most special parents anyone could have. Roses Will Bloom Again shares the true story of her life, the good times and the bad. She had only one sister, who died at the age of four from Rocky Mountain Fever caused by a tick bite. As a result, Frances grew up an only child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After she married, she and her husband, Herbert George, had three beautiful daughtersCarol, Nancy, and Lisa. Sadly, their daughters were not destined to reach adulthood; they died, one by one, of a rare blood disease. By the time Frances was thirty-four years old, she had lost all of her children. Shortly thereafter, her husband began having cardiac issues, having open heart surgery at the age of forty. The couple then went through one thing after another until he died suddenly from a massive heart attack at forty-eight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Frances misses her family terribly, she was so proud of all they accomplished in their short lives, particularly her husband. She was amazed by her two oldest daughters, because as sick as they were, they continued to witness for the Lord wherever they went, leading many souls to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frances hopes her story will be an encouragement to brokenhearted people everywhere, showing them that God is always with them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
