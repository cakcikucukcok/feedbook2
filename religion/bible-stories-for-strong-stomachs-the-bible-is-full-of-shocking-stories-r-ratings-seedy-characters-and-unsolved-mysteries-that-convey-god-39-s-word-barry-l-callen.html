  <title>Bible Stories for Strong Stomachs: The Bible is Full of Shocking Stories, &quot;R&quot; Ratings, Seedy Characters, and Unsolved Mysteries That Convey God&#39;s Word - Barry L. Callen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Intriguing and eye-opening interpretations of the most scandalous Bible stories that are puzzling and even shocking, maybe not even worthy of being in the Bible. A serious and sometimes whimsical taking of readers into the most awkward and even repulsive biblical narratives to find answers to the difficult questions facing believers today. Here is an outstanding resource for young adults, Sunday school classes, and quest groups that will provoke real conversations about the Bible and how the faithful should be living their lives. These twenty-eight Bible stories, strictly for adults, would make great sermon material for the pastor who has the courage and wisdom to try. They surely are in the Bible for some important reason. You are warned to approach with caution." />
