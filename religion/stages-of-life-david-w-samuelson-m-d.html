  <title>Stages of Life - David W. Samuelson M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live in a relativistic society, and many young people do not know what is true and acceptable anymore. Most just believe it is okay to do whatever one wishes. I think there is absolute truth, and it can be found in the Word of God. From my own experiences and study of Gods Word, I have attempted to explore stages of life from birth to death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your birth was special and ordained by God. It was a blessed day, but as you read this book you will discover it is not the best day of your life. God has designed a family in which you grow and develop through your childhood and teen years. He has given you parents to guide and direct you to become responsible adults. He has ordained marriage and given us the awesome privilege in assisting Him in his creative power as we bring children into this world.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In part two of the book I discuss your spiritual heritage, spiritual gifts, prayer, your body, your money, your human failings, and other topics. All these topics are from the perspective of the inspired Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
