  <title>Purpose In Adversity: A Gateway to Destiny - Shanae B. Govan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Broken and neglected, cast out and forgotten, unloved and scarred, hopeless and scared. Life taught me that if I was going to learn to love anything or anyone else, I would first have to love myself. My developing a love for the game of basketball while navigating life&#39;s journey for purpose resulted in me finding a beautiful path orchestrated by the King. What has led me to prominence has been a desire for what is greater than me. God&#39;s truth about who I am and what he&#39;s called me to be led me to my destiny. There came a decisive shift in my life, a pivotal point when things that sought to destroy me no longer defeated me. Rather, I was changed; I was new. My maturation into who God desired for me to be dismantled the victimization I felt by circumstances that haunted me. The essence of time has a healing power unmatched by gifted hands. I appropriated a mind-set that activated God&#39;s truths into my life." />
