  <title>Which Way, Lord? - Rob Fuquay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Christians we hunger to know and live out God&#39;s purpose for our lives. But how do we know for certain which way to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which Way, Lord?&lt;/em&gt; aims to help you understand God&#39;s direction for your life. Your guide for this journey is Paul, the globe-trotting hero of early church history. You will gain ore than an introductory insight into the background, education, experiences, writing, and theology of this man who changed the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through many detours, adversity, and time spent thinking about his life, Paul completely reoriented his understanding of faith and God&#39;s purpose for his life. God placed Paul in a community that shared God&#39;s love with him, and Paul underwent several years of training in his quest to follow Jesus and ultimately follow his call to be a missionary. Like Paul, we encounter many challenges as we try to discover our purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 6-session study helps you unpack your life alongside the life of the apostle Paul to find your purpose and passion. Along the way, you&#39;ll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 5px 20px&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discern and follow God&#39;s leading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explore ways God can use you and your life experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow God&#39;s signals when experiencing adversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;respond to times when you can&#39;t live out your purpose as you would like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;endure hardships and doubts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find ways to persevere with hope and faith&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfect study series for back-to school, the beginning of a new year, Lent, or anytime you need a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
