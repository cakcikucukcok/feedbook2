  <title>Why Did the “Loving” Cross Turn into a Swastika - Istvan Bodnar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Judaism and Christianity differ from each other on the most fundamental issues. Yet both use the same Jewish Bible as the foundation of their faiths. Only one of these belief systems can be true.
Those who talk about Judeo-Christian heritage have no idea that Judaism and Christianity are the most fundamentally conflicting principles in the history of humanity. They inherently cannot co-exist, as light cannot co-exist with darkness. History since the beginning of the Common Era testifies that humanity cannot afford to regard Christianity as an innocent lie, as a bad idea.
A real war is being waged around us between alien spirits and G-ds angels. People usually ignore this unintuitive and invisible reality, but this ongoing celestial conflict often affects our everyday affairs, as if no one is in control.
The Torah and the New Testament cannot co-exist, despite ongoing efforts of Christian preachers to prove the contrary.
This book is intended to be an encouragement to those who have already begun to see though the vicious veil of the Christian delusion.
The basic principle of Christianity is nonsense. Any human being with the weakest sense of justice would reject the idea that someone else died for his or her sins. The fake god came up with the death trick. Death will be its everlasting reward.
Christians are desperate to support their faith with fabricated references from the Torah and Prophets, while those who live on the Torah have never needed the New Testament to support their faith.
Everyone on this planet should have realized the issues presented in this book by now, as theological qualifications or credentials are not necessary to understand them. Mankind has been given more than 2,000 years to comprehend these ideas.
Humanity has paid a heavy price for false rationalizations motivated by a wicked desire to cast off the Torahs requirements. Let us value and safeguard this wisdom acquired with difficulty with unspeakable gratefulness." />
