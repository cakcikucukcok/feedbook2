  <title>The Revealing - Edwin L. Woolsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To the very end of Christ&#39;s ministry, there was a constant human need to know Him.  Having already been warned about a plot to kill Jesus, a group of Christ&#39;s friends privately asked a troubling question concerning future events, What shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world? (Matt. 24:3)  Circumstances were rapidly spiraling out of control, and the disciples longed to understand what would happen next.
In the last 2000 years, the same basic need for awareness has only intensified.  Complex global developments seem almost beyond our ability to address.  Akin to St. Paul&#39;s analogy of labor pains at birth, each new world crisis appears to occur faster and with greater severity than the one before! (1 Thes. 5:3)  Today, people are genuinely hungry for the reality of intimately discovering who Jesus actually is.  Like the early disciples, we have the same nagging desire to know.  Haven&#39;t you felt this need in your own life?
For that reason, the Revelation of Jesus Christ was divinely inspired and written by Apostle John.  Spanning the entire circuit of Creation, the Apocalypse addresses the timeless question, What shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world?   Unlike any other book in the Bible, only the Revelation promises a special blessing to those individuals who explore its amazing prophetic secrets. (Rev. 1:3)  However, without the necessary key to open human understanding, John&#39;s prophecies have remained closed.  Until now!  THE REVEALING is that KEY for unlocking the intricate mysteries of the Revelation of Jesus Christ in order for you to know The Sign of Christ&#39;s Coming and the End of the World!" />
