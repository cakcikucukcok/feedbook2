  <title>Wisdom of Solomon - Mark Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book treats the excellence of wisdom,the means to obtain it, and the happy fruits it produces. It is written in the person of Solomon, and contains his sentiments. But it is uncertain who was the writer. It abounds with instructions and exhortations to kings and all magistrates to minister justice in the commonwealth, teaching all kinds of virtues under the general names of justice and wisdom. It contains also many prophecies of Christ&#39;s coming, passion, resurrection, and other Christian mysteries.  The whole may be divided into three parts. In the first six chapters,  the author admonishes all superiors to love and exercise justice and wisdom. In the next three, he teacheth that wisdom proceedeth only from God, and is procured by prayer and a good life. In the other ten chapters, he show the excellent effects and utility of wisdom and justice." />
