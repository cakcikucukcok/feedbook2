  <title>Kindred Souls - Stephanie Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many of us go through our busy lives with many acquaintances but few true close friends. Most of our daily conversations focus on the mundane, or we barely scratch the surface of what&#39;s going on in our friends&#39; lives as we try to catch up on the run.
We weren&#39;t meant to travel alone.
Yet many of us are afraid to reveal our innermost thoughts, of being too nosy or not &quot;religious enough&quot; to commit to spiritual kinships.
Using the story of Ruth and Naomi as an example, Stephanie Ford describes how to overcome the risk and fear of sharing and explains how to be a faithful listener. She offers new insights that will empower you to build and nurture soul friendships. Through this book you will
    * discover what spiritual friendship is and how it differs from other kinds of friendship
    * find practical ways to develop and nurture spiritual friendships
    * meet spiritual companions from biblical and Christian history
    * explore the most profound friendship of all — friendship with God — and learn how it can transform your life
Kindred Souls is for individuals, prayer partners, or small groups who want to deepen the friendships they already have and open themselves to new possibilities God offers. Let this book guide you as you seek kindred companions to encourage and challenge you on the spiritual journey." />
