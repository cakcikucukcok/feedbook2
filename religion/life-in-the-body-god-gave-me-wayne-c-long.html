  <title>Life in the Body God Gave Me - Wayne C. Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Life in the Body God Gave Me&lt;/i&gt; allows you to experience the intimate thoughts and secrets of Neil H. Tasker, a spastic, who reveals through this writing, his life experiences and devout faith in the God he loved.  The deep feelings portrayed unveil life from his boyhood, when he first heard the words of an innocent child:&lt;i&gt; My mother told me not to laugh at you, but I can&#39;t help it,&lt;/i&gt; through his adult years.  The journey climaxes many years later as Neil makes a final plea to the Virgin Mary to answer his prayers, in the city of Lourdes, for a miracle that would set him free and cure him of cerebral palsy.  This story shows us we cannot ignore that with Gods love and mercy all things are possible.  In His eyes we are created equal, and anyone who puts his trust in God and follows his heart will be truly rewarded." />
