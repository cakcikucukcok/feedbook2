  <title>Soaring as an Eagle over Life’S Challenges - Dr. Josef A. Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every Christian inwardly desires to Soar as an Eagle over lifes Challenges and Dr. Howard brilliantly paints the picture of how that can happen through his book. He used scripture and natures patterns to create magnificent word pictures with the goal of breaking down the wrong, limited, and destructive thinking we allow in our lives.  This book is a must-read for any Christian! 
Pastor Tim Burt Associate Pastor, Living Word Christian Center
Dr. Howard captures the anatomy of the eagle, compares it to the life of a Christian and turns his discovery into ingredients that constitute the recipe of a sumptuous and irresistible meal.  This easy to read and life transforming book will change your perspective of life.  It exposes the lies of the devil and liberates the captives.  You now hold in your hands the key to an abundant life.  Read it and begin to soar as an eagle over lifes challenges.
Rev. Dr. Francis Tabla Senior Pastor, Ebenezer Community Church, Brooklyn Park, MN.  Executive Director, Liberian Ministers Association
Soaring as an Eagle Over Lifes Challenges is insightful, thought provoking, inspirational, motivating, and educational.  This well written and easy to read book compares and contracts the character, anatomy, domestic life, and other attributes of an eagle to that of Christian.  Through inspiring and thought-provoking lessons penned in this book, Dr. Howard highlights for Christians some positive lessons on living above lifes challenges; complicated relationships, finding a life partner, raising a family, and complex social, leadership and financial issues.  This book contains wealth of wisdom and life-transforming principles that will cause you to see yourself as God sees you.
Harris Sumo, BSW Spiritual son to the Author
This book is a byproduct of a powerful sermon I preached a few years ago entitled, Soaring As an Eagle.  Hundreds of believers were blessed by that sermon and many of them pleaded that I turn my manuscript into a book.  Consequently, after months of research, prayers and writing, you now hold in your hands a book that is easy to read, thought provoking, inspirational, encouraging and eye-opening. It teaches you how to cultivate the mind of God concerning your life and situation.  After reading this book, you are going to like the way you think and liveI guarantee it!
