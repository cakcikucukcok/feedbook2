  <title>What If Christians Grew Up? - Yaholo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whats wrong with Christianity? Why does it so often seem like the church is working against good in the world instead of helping it? What if we got the facts right but the story wrong?
What If Christians Grew Up? takes the beliefs most common in mainstream Christianity and puts them under the lens of building a dynamic relationship with God, a relationship in which we began as infants, but through which we grow to be the heirs of God. 
This book was written to equip Christians who are passionate about social justice and effective engagement in the world around us to express their beliefs in a world where the Bible is so often used to justify ignorance and persecution." />
