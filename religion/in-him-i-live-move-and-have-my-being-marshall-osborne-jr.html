  <title>&quot;In Him I Live, Move, and Have My Being&quot; - Marshall Osborne Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;To be his second publication to the Christendom&lt;/U&gt;, the book is heralded&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;for its spiritual enlightenment, enrichment and encouragement. The author &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;has used the concepts of conformation, transformation and reformation to&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;bring out his spiritual walk with Christ which has been quite rewarding to &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;him and those he has ministered to. No doubt he can exclaim the satisfaction,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;contentment and gain as it comes from being perfected and used by his God.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;His intent of this literature is to make the scriptures an opened and rewarding&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;experience with any believer who wants to commit his life and time in&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;becoming the being God wants to create. Apparently he has learned the &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;secret of developing an eternal perspective in the midst of his earthly&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;problems. For he was able to live above his circumstances and rejoice even&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;while being persecuted because of his firm grasp on who he was in Christ&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;and where he was going. In spite of his life situations, he could write, &quot;For&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;in him I live, and move, and have my being.&quot; Being confident of this very &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;thing, that He (God) which hath begun a good work in him will perform it &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;until the day of his coming.&lt;/P&gt;" />
