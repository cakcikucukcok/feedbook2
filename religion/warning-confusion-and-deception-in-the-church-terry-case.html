  <title>Warning! Confusion and Deception in the Church! - Terry Case</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gods Word has much to say to believers but will confound the unbelievers. Confusion has entered the church to deceive believers from Gods truth. The church is not the same when many preachers are proclaiming lies, which is false doctrine. Many denominations have caused this confusion to be sustained as truth through their people for many past generations. People think preachers only proclaim truth. When you tell a lie long enough, you believe it. Some denominations tell the world that Gods Word is full of errors and contradictions, which is what Satan wants to cause more deception. If you do what God wants, you will have peace with God. If you do less than what is expected, God will take your talent and give it to someone else. If you are available, God will meet you there. The Bible does command you to commit your way to the Lord and follow him." />
