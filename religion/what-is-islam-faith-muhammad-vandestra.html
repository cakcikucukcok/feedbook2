  <title>What Is Islam Faith? - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Among the blessings and favors that God has bestowed upon humanity is that He endowed them with an innate ability to recognize and acknowledge His existence.&amp;nbsp; He placed this awareness deep in their hearts as a natural disposition that has not changed since human beings were first created.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, He reinforced this natural disposition with the signs that he placed in creation that testify to His existence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, since it is not possible for human beings to have a detailed knowledge of God except through revelation from Himself, God sent His Messengers to teach the people about their Creator Who they must worship.&amp;nbsp; These Messengers also brought with them the details of how to worship God, because such details cannot be known except by way of revelation.&amp;nbsp; These two fundamentals were the most important things that the Messengers of all the divine revelations brought with them from God.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ultimate goal of every Divine Message has always been the same: to guide the people to God, to make them aware of Him, and to have them worship Him alone.&amp;nbsp; Each Divine Message came to strengthen this meaning, and the following words were repeated on the tongues of all the Messengers: &amp;ldquo;Worship God, you have no god other than Him.&amp;rdquo; This message was conveyed to humanity by prophets and messengers which God sent to every nation.&amp;nbsp; All of these messengers came with this same message, the message of Islam." />
