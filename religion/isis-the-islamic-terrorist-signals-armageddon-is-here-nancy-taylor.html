  <title>Isis: the Islamic Terrorist Signals Armageddon Is Here - Nancy Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is based on the Holy Bible in Revelation regarding the end times and the final battle between good and evil, the mark of the beast, his image and the fall of Babylon. We are in a spiritual warfare and God gives us tools to use to overcome the evil spirits, the False Prophet, and Satan who rules them for his own political evil agenda of a New World Order. It is highly critical we know who they are and how to apply Gods tools in our daily lives. We are witnessing in our lives today and what it means for us. For Satan is in the race with us and will do everything in his power to prevent us from winning the race with God. Satan knows his time is short and his False Prophet is not wasting any time recruiting and growing. We must be more diligent, bold and prepared than ever before in knowing Gods Word, the catastrophic events to come and our faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
