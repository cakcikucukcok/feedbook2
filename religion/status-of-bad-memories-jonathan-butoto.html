  <title>Status of Bad Memories - Jonathan Butoto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His book Status of Bad Memories was written just after the tragedy that happened in Democratic Republic of Congo in 1996 until 2004. He was shocked at the way he and other people from his tribe were marginalized and was horrified that they were being killed by other tribes from Congo and Interahamwe extremist groups from the neighboring country of Rwanda. This book delivers a true account of what happened during the civil war in Congo. Many people died, and Gabby survived the tragedy. With this book, he is thanking Americans and all people who contributed to the protection of his life and family from the hands of killers. 
He says that there is something inside his heart. The tragedy was caused by the war that happened in DRC. During that time, tears were everywhere in the country. People have been hunted as if they were wild animals. He saw this tragedy with his two eyes. He could stand in a hidden place to see what was happening. Women and children were also killed. His brothers and sisters became homeless. They are now wandering everywhere in the world. Killing a person was no longer a sin but a game to some tribes in Congo. This book is a mediator, a bridge to make Congo a holy place to live in and remind new generation that Congo deserves development instead of having killings, quarrels, and instability." />
