  <title>Marriage Vows Under Fire Mega Series 1: Gold Bands In The Fire - Lanette Zavala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Natalie and Joseph Reyes have everything any young interracial couple could desire - a loving marriage, children together, wealth, and enterprise. But the demands of a controlling mother-in-law and her husband&amp;#39;s unaccounted hours spent in places unknown to Natalie threaten to drive a wedge between them. With dwindling trust in her beloved accompanied by mysterious symptoms within her body, Natalie agonizes as a single mother within her marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Relatives who witness Natalie&amp;#39;s faith can only wish for her problems. An adulterous past and scandalous tendencies threaten to shatter the love between Shasta and Javier Reyes. Unknown to their family, a violent face-off occurs when Natalie&amp;#39;s psychotic cousin, Emma Jean, torments the men who attempted to kidnap her. Cousin Tiphany Taylor hopes to marry the wealthy father of her children until reality forces her to make a heart-wrenching decision. Alicia Reyes goes on a manhunt for her meddling widowed mother and finds a homeless man to groom for the mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shattering worlds of the prominent Reyes and Taylor families blend as a distractive force against the couple, who married from each family. Surrounded by everyone else&amp;acirc;??s drama, Natalie and Joseph rarely find time to strengthen what she sees as a starving marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marriage Vows Under Fire Mega Series 1 is an extensive version of Wedding Vows Under Fire Launch Series." />
