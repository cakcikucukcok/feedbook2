  <title>Lukewarm Christian to Warrior for Christ - Charles J. Pettitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The United States of America is at a tipping point. Like the teeter-totter I played on as a child, our beloved country is about to go from a godly country to an ungodly one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If we do not act now, the liberties that we Christians have enjoyed since the birth of our nation are at risk of being eliminated. If we do not ?ght in unity, we will lose our country to secularists who believe Christianity is for the weak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We need warriors, Christian warriors to take to the battle?eld and defeat the enemy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; BUT HOW DOES ONE BECOME A WARRIOR FOR CHRIST? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The samurai are arguably the greatest warriors ever. Imagine incorporating their dedication and self-sacri?ce into your Christian walk; what a great Warrior for Christ you could become! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It will not be easy, and you will be tested, but God is with you, as he was with Joshua: Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go. JOSHUA 1:9 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; ITS TIME TO PREPARE FOR BATTLE. &lt;/p&gt;" />
