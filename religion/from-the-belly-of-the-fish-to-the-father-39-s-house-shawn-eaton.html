  <title>From the Belly of the Fish to the Father&#39;s House - Shawn Eaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is based on a true story. The Holy Spirit helped me to remember the way God the Father walked me threw all my troubles. I am a miracle, a living testimony. I give the Lord all the glory to this story of my life. If there is something you got yourself in or the devil has attacked you, I want to introduce you to the living God, who can deliver, make free, heal, redeem, and much, much more. Felonies, criminal lifestyle, and addictionsit&#39;s not too hard for the Lord.
This book is to inspire, encourage, and point to the One who can make a way out of no way. My prayer is that the reader of this book be blessed, body, soul, and spirit. Nobody can do you like Jesus. He delivered me out of all my troubles. Psalms 34:19: &quot;Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivered him out of them all.&quot; Not some but all. Try the Lord for yourself. He cannot lie, and he cannot fail. Be blessed." />
