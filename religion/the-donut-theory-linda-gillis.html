  <title>The Donut Theory - Linda Gillis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Donut Theory is written not only for church staff members, but also for all who are familiar with church ways. Through firsthand experience, Linda Gillis shares meditative, folksy parables, and facts. If you wonder what goes on in the church office from Monday through Friday, youll find out in The Donut Theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church staff will identify with The Donut Theory, and church members will be entertained and enlightened. &lt;br /&gt;Reverend Gerald W. Nelson, retired ELCA pastor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These folksy meditations (part narrative, part advice) express the messy mix of human and divine in the church administrative experience, by one whos been there. &lt;br /&gt;Sara Dyrud Bryan, former church secretary and pastors wife&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading The Donut Theory, I gave it to my church secretary. The next time I saw her, she said, I found myself laughing out loud  many of the stories could have been written about my office!  &lt;br /&gt;Gwynne, Sun City, Arizona&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindas meditations are rich in learning experiences and are reinforced by her faith and ability to find humor in any situation. &lt;br /&gt;Shirley Cunningham, LCSWW, &lt;br /&gt;spiritual director, and author of Chasing God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Donut Theory is a compilation of Lindas first three books released in 2009, 2010, and 2012, under the title Incidents (and Inspiration) from the Church Office I, II, and III52 Meditations for Church Support Staff. Copies of all of Lindas books are available through her website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://souly4youbylindagillis.com/&quot;&gt;http://souly4youbylindagillis.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
