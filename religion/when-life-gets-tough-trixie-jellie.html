  <title>When Life Gets Tough - Trixie Jellie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine someone trying to kill you by physically assaulting you then hurling you off a bridge onto parked cars six metres below. Somehow you miraculously survive. Would that change your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 1989, a middle-aged housewife and mother was thrown off an overbridge in Auckland&amp;#39;s CBD. The assailant, a complete stranger, changed many lives that day. A random act of violence in broad daylight left Trixie Jellie with life-threatening injuries. The New Zealand public was shocked, and the memory still lingers with people to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trixie has faced many battles and challenges over the years. She has learnt to ride the highs and lows with a positive attitude and her faith in God as her constant companion and source of strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shocking, heartfelt and encouraging, this book is the story of a remarkable life, and proof of the impact of positive choices in tough times. It is a story of healing, forgiveness, faith and courage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
