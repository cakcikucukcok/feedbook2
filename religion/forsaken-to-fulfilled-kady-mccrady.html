  <title>Forsaken to Fulfilled - Kady McCrady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout the night I cried to the Lord with tears of brokenness that flooded my pillow, and pleaded with him: Why have you forsaken me, O Lord? How long do I have to live like this? I cant take it anymore! I have prayed for so long! Did you forget about me? Please, help me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them. (Isaiah 42:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not forget youI have inscribed you on the palms of my hands. (Isaiah 49:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose. (Isaiah 44:28 ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kady is to be commended for sharing her life with others. Her book, Forsaken to Fulfilled, is well documented with Gods Word and demonstrates how he will help in time of need. When she set her eyes on Gods Word, she found victory, healing, and fulfillment as a woman. In this world, we need more courageous individuals like Kady to stand up and be a voice for the vulnerable and hurting. This book should be read by every couple.&lt;/p&gt;
