  <title>Resurrecting Easter: Meditations for the Great 50 Days - Kate Moorehead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="American Christians have forgotten the Easter season.  We celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus on one day and then we return to ordinary time.  But Christ appeared over and over again for forty days in resurrected form.  We cannot sustain this resurrection season because that kind of sustained joy overwhelms us. This book is designed to help us sustain Easter.  o People love to read devotional books in Lent.  This gives them something to read in Easter. o Readers will move more deeply into an understanding of the resurrection and how it impacts us now. o Christians have lost the most pivotal aspect of our faith: the radical nature of the resurrection.  This is a reminder of that most incredible event and its claim on all of our lives." />
