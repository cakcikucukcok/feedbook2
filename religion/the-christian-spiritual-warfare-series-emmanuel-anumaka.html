  <title>The Christian Spiritual  Warfare Series - Emmanuel Anumaka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Christian Spiritual Warfare Series is a book designed for all Christians who want to defeat the devil in the everyday battle of life. The Bible stated in Ephesians Chapter 6 that we wrestle not against flesh and blood (individuals) but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 
Satans intension is to kill, steal and destroy. This mission he wants to accomplish in the life of every Christian. This book is designed to be a daily prayer guide or manual to help the believer to scatter every plan of the enemy even before they are conceived. 
The book has been written for those that want to be free from all demonic operations against their lives. 
The book guides the reader to follow the footsteps of our LORD JESUS CHRIST who defeated Satan during his temptation using the Word of God. 
The consistent use of the prayer points included in this book will help the believer to be conversant with the relevant Bible passages for warfare. It will also help him to meditate on the Word of God day and night so that he will be shielded from every plan of the devil." />
