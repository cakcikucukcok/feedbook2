  <title>Our Hope in the Fear of the Lord and His Amazing Grace - Janice E. Ballard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our Hope in the Fear of the Lord and His Amazing Grace sees clearly the truths of human life. The Lord does not hold individuals inherited sinful nature against them, but He does hold each person accountable for accepting or rejecting the grace that grants freedom from the powers of sin and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice E. Ballard, as a young mother and leader in her local church, has written Our Hope in the Fear of the Lord and His Amazing Grace to help adults fulfill their calling to teach youth how to guard themselves from the dangers that modern life pose to faith in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter begins by grounding its reflections on a scriptural passage. Additional guidance from the Holy Bible keeps that focus as the chapters address topics like gaining knowledge of God, departing from evil, trusting in Gods love, acknowledging sin, escaping from self-destruction, feeling security, embracing peace of heart, and praising and glorifying God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need encouragement to renew your hope in God, to trust in His grace, and to see afresh the purifying effects of a healthy fear of the Lord, then Our Hope in the Fear of the Lord and His Amazing Grace will give you the guidance to listen to the Scriptures. Through such attentive listening, you can nurture your own faith and gain the insights to help othersespecially young peoplecome to trust deeply in the hope that comes from the fear of the Lord and the amazing grace He offers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
