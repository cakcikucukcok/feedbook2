  <title>The Beast and Babylon - J.B. Whitelaw-Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Beast and Babylon answers some age-old questions about the two symbolic entities featured in the book of Revelation. These symbols have historically been typified as a revived Roman Empire, and its God-opposing religious counterparts that rise up (in Europe), prior to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. In contrast, this informative and timely study reveals that the latter-day beast power rises out of not one, but out of three defunct previous empires in the Middle East; knownvia Daniels metaphorsas the lion, bear, and leopard kingdoms. It appears from Daniel 7:1112, that long after the last manifestation of the Roman Empire is destroyed, these three dormant empires are revived for a season and a time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;During their rejuvenation, they reappear in Revelation 13 and 17 in the form of a tripartite, seven-headed, political/religious beast power that emerges from the topographies of the ancient Grecian (leopard), Persian (bear), and Babylonian (lion) kingdoms. Furthermore, these combined territories encompass ten sovereign Islamic horn nations that were revealed after the Ottoman Empire was abolished ninety-five years ago. Today, many of these Islamic nations contain embedded terrorist groups whose fanatical Jihadist leaders are determined to resurrect a radical pan-Islamic Caliphate, by which to establish Sharia law throughout the World. To achieve these objectives, the latter-day nascent imperial beast powerin conjunction with ten like-minded insurgent leadersmust initiate a global Jihad to incite war on the people of God, and conspire to destroy a religious city called Mystery, Babylon the Great.&lt;/p&gt;" />
