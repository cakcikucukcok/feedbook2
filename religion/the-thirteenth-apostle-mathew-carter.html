  <title>The Thirteenth Apostle - Mathew Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are two things good and that which must become good. Humanity does not understand this.
Reality and pseudoreality. There is God, and there is man. If a man seeks truth, he must be eligible for the reception of truth. Mankind does not know this. Consequently, believing in the existence of truth, he assumes he is therefore able to perceive it. This is not in accordance with experience in our religions, but it continues to be believed, particularly by the four thousand religions on the earth that we follow blindly.
The science of effecting a bridge between the inner and outer man has been rare, and for the most part forgotten, inevitably there are those that think their religion stands them in good stead and accept the truth of these lesser experiences and rituals when they worship. They are wrong. Gods heart lies only with the Sufis.
A man cut down a tree one day. A Sufi who saw this taking place said, Look at this fresh branch, which is full of sap, happy because it does not yet know it has been cut off and ignorant of the damage that it has suffered. But it will know in due time. Meanwhile you cannot reason with it.
This severance, this ignorancethese are the states of the leaders of religion, worshiping the ceremonies rather than God." />
