  <title>Witness to Freedom - Thomas Merton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Witness to Freedom&lt;/i&gt; is the fifth and final volume in the extraordinary correspondence of &quot;one of the most original and challenging minds of the mid-twentieth century&quot; (John  Tracy Ellis, The New York Times Book Review). Dramatic and revealing, these letters deal with periods of serious crisis in Thomas Merton&#39;s life and vocation, giving readers, in his own words, the details and behind-the-scene facts of his personal struggles as well as his lifelong commitment to peace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This remarkable collection includes the unpublished &quot;Cold War Letters&quot; (as well as a complete list of the series), with Merton&#39;s original preface, which confirms their continuing relevance in the cause of peace. There are letters to ecologist Rachel Carson; artist and type designer Victor Hammer; Merton&#39;s friend and agent Naomi Burton Stone; his teacher Mark Van Doren; the Canadian philosopher Leslie Dewart; the French Arabic scholar Louis Massignon; and other famous as well as unknown correspondents. There is a courageous open letter to the American hierarchy on the issue of war. Witness to Freedom shows Merton as a living witness against war, perhaps one of the greatest of our century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
