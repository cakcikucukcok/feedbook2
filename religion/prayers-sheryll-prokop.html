  <title>Prayers - Sheryll Prokop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When we make our spiritual life, our walk with Christ, and our faith journey our number one priority, all else is secondary to Christs plan for our lives. When we choose to become Christians, our priority is Gods will and our faith. Every little thing in our life is from God and is for a reason. If he brought a situation or person to us, we can trust that there is a purpose. We can seek to find his purpose in all things, in all ways, and in all situations by spending time in prayer. We can invoke his spirit and ask him to guide us, to be with us, and to show us what he wants us to do or to accomplish. We simply need to pray, trust him, listen to him, and be willing to do whatever he asks us to do according to his will and purpose.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we dont know how to pray, what to do, or we simply just do not know what to say to him. The first thing to do is to place ourselves in the ever-loving presence of our Heavenly Father, our Lord and Savior, and then open our hearts to feel his loving presence upon us, around us, and within us, and really soak in his healing power, his love, his light, his grace, his mercy, and his forgiveness. Then, we just start talking to him. Ask him to fill us with his love, peace, hope, and joy. Ask him to give us courage, strength, and perseverance. Ask him for healing, mercy, grace, and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are no magical, godly, or celestial words that God needs to hear to answer prayers. These prayers are intended to help lead us into a conversation with God and to give us the words when we dont know what to pray.&lt;/p&gt;" />
