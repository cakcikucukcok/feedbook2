  <title>Kate Chopin: The Complete Works (Annotated) - Kate Chopin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During her career as a writer, Kate Chopin wrote many short stories, and novels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her first novel was At Fault (1889), and two short stories collections where published in 1894 and 1897: Bayou Folk and A Night In Acadie. All of these works depicted the life in Louisiana and were at the time well received by critics and by the public.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1899, the publication of her novel The Awakening resulted in outrage, due to the actions of the main character and her lack of remorse.&lt;br /&gt;
The works of Kate Chopin are today part of the American literature canon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will find them all in this meticulously compiled edition, which includes previously uncollected short stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book contains the following works :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Bayou Folk, a short stories collection.&lt;br /&gt;
- A Night in Acadie, another short stories collection.&lt;br /&gt;
- At Fault, a novel.&lt;br /&gt;
- The Awakening, a novel, followed by short stories.&lt;br /&gt;
- Previously uncollected short stories." />
