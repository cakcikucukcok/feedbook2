  <title>Secret Bodyguard (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - B.J. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Amanda Crowe&#39;s baby girl had been kidnapped! In the shadowy world in which she lived, there was no one to trust except herself. She was going to get her baby back no matter the cost. But she hadn&#39;t counted on Jesse McCall getting in her way–a man who was more than he seemed….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Posing as Amanda&#39;s driver, undercover cop Jesse McCall was assigned to watch the mobster&#39;s daughter. But he couldn&#39;t ignore Amanda&#39;s heart-wrenching effort to bring her child home, nor her siren&#39;s call luring him ever closer. As a cop, Jesse had a duty to fulfill. But as Amanda&#39;s lover, he would protect her and her baby from all harm–even if it meant breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
