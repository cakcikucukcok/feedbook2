  <title>My Lady Ludlow - Elizabeth Gaskell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am an old woman now, and things are very different to what they were in my youth. Then we, who travelled, travelled in coaches, carrying six inside, and making a two days’ journey out of what people now go over in a couple of hours with a whizz and a flash, and a screaming whistle, enough to deafen one. Then letters came in but three times a week: indeed, in some places in Scotland where I have stayed when I was a girl, the post came in but once a month;—but letters were letters then; and we made great prizes of them, and read them and studied them like books. Now the post comes rattling in twice a day, bringing short jerky notes, some without beginning or end, but just a little sharp sentence, which well-bred folks would think too abrupt to be spoken. Well, well! They may all be improvements,—I dare say they are; but you will never meet with a Lady Ludlow in these days." />

"My Lady Ludlow" is the story of the small rural village of Hanbury around the year 1800, its ways unchanged for centuries.<br /><b><i>My Lady Ludlow: Gaskell, Elizabeth: 9781461044536: Amazon ...</i></b> | My Lady Ludlow is Elizabeth Gaskell's charming tale of the conflict between progress and tradition, set in the England of 1800. Lady Ludlow is a kind, generous, and responsible member of the English aristocracy. She is also a trenchant traditionalist, virulently opposed to any move that would bring change to the social order.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>My Lady Ludlow - Elizabeth Gaskell</a> </h3></p><hr/>
