  <title>Evelina: or, The History of a Young Lady&#39;s Entrance into the World - Fanny Burney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Good-looking, kind-hearted Evelina Anville has grown up in rural obscurity as the ward of a country parson. At the age of seventeen, she begins her progress from provincial life to fashionable London &amp;#8213; a transition that&#39;s complicated by vulgar relatives and her own naivet&amp;#233;. Evelina&#39;s shrewd intelligence, however, perceives the hypocrisy behind the refined fa&amp;#231;ades as she learns to balance the honesty and simplicity of her upbringing with the sophisticated etiquette of high society.&lt;BR&gt;Written in the form of letters, this 1778 novel offers an intimate look at coming-of-age among England&#39;s eighteenth-century upper crust. Evelina&#39;s comic misadventures provide a subtle commentary on some of the problems faced by her contemporaries, from women&#39;s limited roles to class snobbery and prejudice. Fanny Burney&#39;s witty approach to manners and mores was a significant influence on Jane Austen, and her deft combination of satire, sentimentality, and farce provides sparkling entertainment.&lt;BR&gt;" />
