  <title>Under the Lilacs - Louisa May Alcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="„Under the Lilacs”, published in 1878, is another lovely morality tale by Louisa May Alcott that centers around two young girls who are having a tea party with their dolls when they stumble upon a young boy and his dog who have run away from the circus. Ben and his trained dog, Sancho, run away from the circus and soon find a warm welcome in a kind community where spirited games are played. Theatricals and imaginative pageantry are all part of the fun. This book by Louisa May Alcott will delight readers young and old and remind them that kindness wins the day. The author clearly was fascinated by the moral, physical, and emotional lives and upbringing of boys and girls as they make the transition from youth to young adulthood. A fine example of classic children’s literature." />
