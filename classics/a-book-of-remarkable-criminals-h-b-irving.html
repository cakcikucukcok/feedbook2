  <title>A Book of Remarkable Criminals - H.B. Irving</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you fascinated by the nefarious figures in history who have opted to walk a darker path in life? Armchair criminologists will take devilish delight in this gruesome collection of true-crime tales. The volume brings together concise biographies of depraved, delusional, and just plain evil louts, ne&amp;#39;er-do-wells and murderers, along with gripping accounts of their misdeeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
H. B. Irving (5 August 1870 &amp;ndash; 17 October 1919), was a British stage actor and actor-manager; the eldest son of Sir Henry Irving and his wife Florence (n&amp;eacute;e O&amp;#39;Callaghan), and father of designer Laurence Irving and actress Elizabeth Irving. Although, as a child, he appeared a couple of times in his father&amp;#39;s productions, it was intended that he would become a lawyer. He attended Marlborough College and New College, Oxford where he studied law and appeared in some student productions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Afterwards, in 1894, he was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple, but instead of pursuing a career as a barrister he decided to become an actor, taking the stage name H. B. Irving to distinguish himself from his father.&lt;br /&gt;
