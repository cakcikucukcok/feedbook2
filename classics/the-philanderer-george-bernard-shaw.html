  <title>The Philanderer - George Bernard Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A lady and gentleman are making love to one another in the drawing room of a flat in Ashley Gardens in the Victoria district of London. The lady is a young widow, Grace Tranfield, in love with the man, Leonard Charteris, who is the ‘philanderer’ of the title. Grace is shocked and disconcerted to find that Charteris, on his own light?hearted admission, has been in a similar position with Julia Craven and others. The affair with Julia, in fact, has never been broken off. He maintains that it is not his fault that half the women he speaks to fall in love with him; and he is in full flight of cajolery when Julia Craven herself erupts on to the scene, attacks Grace, and announces her intention of staying until Charteris has given her up." />

It was written in 1893 but the strict British censorship laws at the time meant that it was not produced on stage until 1902. It is one of the three plays Shaw published as Plays Unpleasant in 1898, alongside Widowers' Houses and Mrs Warren's Profession.<br /><b><i>The Philanderer - Wikipedia</i></b> | "The Philanderer" is the first play I've read by George Bernard Shaw. The plot is set off by the idea of an "Ibsenite" club, influenced by the work of the master Norwegian playwright to break down barriers between men's and women's behavior. To join the club, one has to prove that one is neither manly nor womanly.<br /><b><i>The Philanderer by George Bernard Shaw - Goodreads</i></b> | The Philanderer by George Bernard Shaw (Author) 3.3 out of 5 stars 10 ratings<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Philanderer - George Bernard Shaw</a> </h3></p><hr/>
