  <title>Love’s Comedy -  Henrik Ibsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Henrik Ibsen is the great Norwegian playwright known of course for &amp;quot;A Doll&amp;rsquo;s House&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hedda Gabler&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ghosts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Master Builder&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Love&amp;rsquo;s Comedy&amp;quot;, bittersweet comedy written in 1862, &amp;nbsp;is one of his earliest plays, released before &amp;quot;Brand and Peer Gynt&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Love&amp;rsquo;s Comedy&amp;quot; is considered Ibsen&amp;#39;s first assured masterpiece, written in verse and in language loaded with vivid imagery and passion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two students, Falk and Lind, are staying at the country house of Mrs. Halm, romancing her two daughters Anna and Svanhild. Lind has ambitions to be a missionary, Falk a great poet. Falk criticises bourgeois society in his verse and insists that we live in the passionate moment. Lind&amp;#39;s proposal of marriage to Anna is accepted, but Svanhild rejects the chance to become Falk&amp;#39;s muse, as poetry is merely writing, and he can do that on his own and without really risking himself for his beliefs." />
