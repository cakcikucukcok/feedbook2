      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad.&lt;/b&gt; Jim, a young British seaman, becomes first mate on the Patna, a ship full of pilgrims travelling to Mecca for the hajj. When the ship starts rapidly taking on water and disaster seems imminent, Jim joins his captain and other crew members in abandoning the ship and its passengers. A few days later, they are picked up by a British ship. However, the Patna and its passengers are later also saved, and the reprehensible actions of the crew are exposed. The other participants evade the judicial court of inquiry, leaving Jim to the court alone. He is publicly censured for this action and the novel follows his later attempts at coming to terms with his past. The novel is counted as one of 100 best books of the 20th century." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Lord Jim - Joseph Conrad</i></b> | Lord Jim is a novel by Joseph Conrad originally published as a serial in Blackwood's Magazine from October 1899 to November 1900. An early and primary event in the story is the abandonment of a passenger ship in distress by its crew, including a young British seaman named Jim.<br /><b><i>Lord Jim - Wikipedia</i></b> | Lord Jim is a classic story of one man's tragic failure and eventual redemption, told under the circumstances of high adventure at the margins of the known world which made Conrad's work so immediately popular.<br /><b><i>Lord Jim: Conrad, Joseph, Sherry, Norman: 9780679405443 ...</i></b> | Joseph Conrad was one of the best English writers in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His take on the self assigned class of privilege abused by the Europeans at that time is spot on. His description of Jim as a person not able to accept his own imperfections and his self imposed banishment draws the reader to inspect their own values.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Lord Jim - Joseph Conrad</a> </h3></p><hr/>
