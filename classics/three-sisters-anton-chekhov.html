  <title>Three Sisters - Anton Chekhov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Three Sisters&amp;quot;, as all of Chekhov&amp;#39;s most popular plays, was written near the end of his life, in 1900. &amp;quot;Three Sisters&amp;quot; was the first play that Chekhov wrote specifically for the Moscow Art Theatre, having experienced commercial success in his previous collaborations with the company, &amp;quot;The Seagull&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Uncle Vanya&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The play is set in a small, remote town dominated by an army base. The action takes place in the Prozorov family home over a span of several years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Born and bred in a thriving metropolis, the Prozorovs came to this small town when their father was made commander of the local army brigade. Now, the Prozorov family consists of four siblings: Olga, Masha, Andrei and Irina, the youngest. Three sisters and one brother.&lt;br /&gt;
Both of the Prozorovs&amp;rsquo; parents have died. The mother many years ago; the father precisely one year earlier, on Irina&amp;rsquo;s 21st birthday. Irina&amp;rsquo;s 22nd birthday is thus also the first anniversary of her father&amp;rsquo;s death. Old family friends and acquaintances drop in on the family to mark the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;
Amongst the visitors is Colonel Vershinin, the new brigade commander, who has only recently arrived in town and becomes a spark of new potential, particularly for Masha.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Each act of the play moves forward in time, charting five years in the life of the town, its soldiers, the Prozorov household and its three sisters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The characters of &amp;quot;Three Sisters&amp;quot; are outstanding examples of Chekhovian boredom, longing, and listlessness. The playwright portrays the sisters&amp;rsquo; social aspirations with sensitivity and irony, using them as emblems of Russian middle-class pretensions and despair." />
