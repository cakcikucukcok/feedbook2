Quite unlike the realistic fiction for which Eliot is best known, The Lifted Veil explores themes of extrasensory perception , the essence of physical life, possible life after death , and the power of fate .<br /><b><i>The Lifted Veil (novella) - Wikipedia</i></b> | The Lifted Veil, first published in 1859, is a novella by George Eliot which explores themes of extrasensory perception, life after death, and the power of fate. Eliot is mostly known for her realistic fiction but this novella is a notable part of the Victorian tradition of horror fiction.<br /><b><i>The Lifted Veil by George Eliot - Goodreads</i></b> | George Eliot can be incredibly insightful, elegant, and poignant. This fine work does not quite rise to that level. In case that it matters I think her most accessible and readable short traditional novel is "Silas Marner". "The Lifted Veil" is written in first person and who is described in terms of literary commentary as an "unreliable narrator".<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Lifted Veil - George Eliot</a> </h3></p><hr/>
