  <title>Chamber Music - James Joyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chamber Music is a collection of poems by James Joyce, first published in May of 1907. The collection originally comprised thirty-four love poems, but two further poems were added before publication (&amp;quot;All day I hear the noise of waters&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I hear an army charging upon the land&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although the poems did not sell well, they received some critical acclaim. Ezra Pound admired the &amp;quot;delicate temperament&amp;quot; of these early poems, while Yeats described &amp;quot;I hear an army charging upon the land&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;a technical and emotional masterpiece&amp;quot;. In 1909, Joyce wrote to his wife, &amp;quot;When I wrote [Chamber Music], I was a lonely boy, walking about by myself at night and thinking that one day a girl would love me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
James Joyce (1882-1941), Irish novelist, noted for his experimental use of language in such works as Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939). Joyce&amp;#39;s technical innovations in the art of the novel include an extensive use of interior monologue; he used a complex network of symbolic parallels drawn from the mythology, history, and literature, and created a unique language of invented words, puns, and allusions.&lt;br /&gt;
James Joyce was born in Dublin, on February 2, 1882, as the son of John Stanislaus Joyce, an impoverished gentleman, who had failed in a distillery business and tried all kinds of professions, including politics and tax collecting. Joyce&amp;#39;s mother, Mary Jane Murray, was ten years younger than her husband. She was an accomplished pianist, whose life was dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. In spite of their poverty, the family struggled to maintain a solid middle-class facade." />
