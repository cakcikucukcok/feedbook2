          &lt;strong&gt;P.I. Mack Steele had loved Jamie Shepherd from the moment he&#39;d met herbut she&#39;d always been off-limits - until her frantic phone call reached out to him in the dead of night.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jamie couldn&#39;t deny her fear when her gift returned. Her disturbing dreams were too real - trapped in a macabre fun house, a woman needed her help. Nor could Jamie deny her forbidden attraction to her dark, sexy protector.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lured back to the hometown she&#39;d long ago escaped, Jamie had only Mack to save her from her dreamsand the very real, very twisted killer who&#39;d lured her into his game. But would Mack be enough?&lt;/p&gt;
