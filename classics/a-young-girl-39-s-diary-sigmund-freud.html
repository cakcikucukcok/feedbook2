  <title>A Young Girl&#39;s Diary - Sigmund Freud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Between overseeing his private practice and developing an entirely new field of research and inquiry that would profoundly influence Western culture, Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud somehow came across and helped to publish the diary of an anonymous young girl of the European upper classes. The detailed journal follows the young authoress from the age of 11 to the age of 14 1/2, through high school, schoolyard crushes, and the tumult of adolescence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sigmund Freud (6 May 1856 &amp;ndash; 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austrian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939." />
