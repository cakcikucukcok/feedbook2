  <title>—Jack Liddle—Positive Knick and Knack - Anthony Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Knick and Knack are brothers who were born into an uppermiddle-class family during the first half of the 1950s.
Their lives were dominated with television, comic books, and mysterious new media accounts that take the brothers into the realm of mind-altering synthetic substances along with the electric hard-rock music and the Vietnam War. This comic tragedy continues on and concludes in the wilds of Baja, California.
Jack Liddle represents the irrepressible optimist. His positive mental demeanor, which he inherited from his father, is the focal point of his life. No matter what depths of despair he finds himself, he manages to return to where he resonates best: positive thinking. As the story progresses, Jack technically upgrades himself, which allows him to move forward, whereas most people his age become tranquil as they relive their past. With the advent of the Internet, Jack attracts an audience who follows his adventures and, ultimately, a grand misadventure." />
