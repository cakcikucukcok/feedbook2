  <title>The Sin of Abbé Mouret - Émile Zola, Valerie Minogue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;I really don&#39;t understand how people can blame a priest so much, when he strays from the path.&#39;
Serge Mouret, is an obsessively devout priest, aspiring to perfect purity and sanctity. A serious illness leaves him with amnesia, and no longer knowing he is a priest, he falls in love with his nurse Albine. Together they roam an Eden-like garden called the &#39;Paradou&#39;, seeking a forbidden tree, beneath whose boughs they make love. Anguish follows, as the abbé regains his memory and returns to the church.
In this, the fifth novel in the Rougon-Macquart series, Zola concentrates on the conflict between church and nature; celibacy and sexuality. The Sin of Abbé Mouret is Zola&#39;s version of the Fall of Man and has many biblical parallels. The novel stands out among the author&#39;s work for its lyricism and the extravagant beauty of the descriptions.  The edition includes a wide-ranging introduction and useful historical notes." />
