  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Demons - Fyodor Dostoevsky</i></b> | Demons as satire. A common criticism of Demons, particularly from Dostoevsky's liberal and radical contemporaries, is that it is exaggerated and unrealistic, a result of the author's over-active imagination and excessive interest in the psycho-pathological. However, despite giving freedom to his imagination, Dostoevsky took great pains to derive the novel's characters and story from real people and real ideas of the time.<br /><b><i>Demons (Dostoevsky novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | Demons was more difficult to follow than Dostoevsky's other works. There are numerous characters that make minor appearances that come and go in the first half of the novel. Once you get the characters straightened out, the novel becomes engrossing. Dostoevsky is a master of plot structure and characterization.<br /><b><i>Demons: A Novel in Three Parts (Vintage Classics ...</i></b> | Demons is a novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, first published in the journal The Russian Messenger in 1871â€“2. It is considered one of the four masterworks written by Dostoyevsky after his return from Siberian exile, along with Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Demons - Fyodor Dostoevsky</a> </h3></p><hr/>
