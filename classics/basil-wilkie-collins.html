In Basil we see the emergence of the style and techniques that would lead to the future success and strength of Collins's sensation novels. While Basil offers only staggered glimpses of a major Victorian novelist, it is still a novel well-worth reading.<br /><b><i>Basil by Wilkie Collins - Goodreads</i></b> | Wilkie Collins excels at drawing back the curtain of a society where outward manners and social position are not always what they appear to be. As this novel demonstrates, the underbelly of evil and corruption can be exposed in discreet and subtle ways. Basil has plenty of spice...definitely a good read! 7 people found this helpful<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Basil - Wilkie Collins</a> </h3></p><hr/>
