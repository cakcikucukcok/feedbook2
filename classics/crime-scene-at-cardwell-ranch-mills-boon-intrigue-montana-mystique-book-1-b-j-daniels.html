  <title>Crime Scene at Cardwell Ranch (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Montana Mystique, Book 1) - B.J. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;After Hudson Savage betrayed her, Dana Cardwell hoped never to lay eyes on the seductive cowboy again. Until a bunch of old bones showed up on her family ranch. Suddenly her former lover was back in her life in a big way-to investigate a decades-old crime.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Five years ago, Hud left town with a heart load of regrets. But now, as acting interim marshal, he had a job to do. And this time he wasn&#39;t walking away. Because now Dana&#39;s life was on the line-as the unsuspecting target of a killer who still walked the canyon. Hud would do whatever it took to keep Dana close. Even if it meant risking his own heart for a second chance for both of them….&lt;/p&gt;
