  <title>Against War - Desiderius Erasmus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dutch thinker and theologian Desiderius Erasmus played a key role in the development of humanism during the Renaissance and early modern periods. In Against War, Erasmus mounts a stunningly lucid and detailed argument against armed combat on humanistic grounds. It&amp;#39;s a must-read for anyone who has strong feelings about the moral and ethical dimensions of militaristic undertakings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Desiderius Erasmus (28 October 1466 &amp;ndash; 12 July 1536), known as Erasmus or Erasmus of Rotterdam, was a Dutch Renaissance humanist, Catholic priest, social critic, teacher, and theologian.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Erasmus was a classical scholar and wrote in a pure Latin style. Among humanists he enjoyed the sobriquet &amp;quot;Prince of the Humanists&amp;quot;, and has been called &amp;quot;the crowning glory of the Christian humanists&amp;quot;. Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament, which raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation. He also wrote On Free Will, In Praise of Folly, Handbook of a Christian Knight, On Civility in Children, Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style, Julius Exclusus, and many other works." />
