          &lt;strong&gt;IN ONE MOMENT, THEIR LIVES HAD CHANGED FOREVER…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There weren&#39;t many things a man felt he could count on, but Darryl Andrews had always been sure of his place in the world, with his wife, Faith, by his side. They&#39;d been just kids themselves when they married, but now, five children later, he thought they&#39;d seen it all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And then the tornado hit. They were grateful to have survived. Still, things didn&#39;t seem right. Could their rock-solid marriage actually be faltering? Suddenly Darryl was sure of only one thing: He had to fight for Faith&#39;s love.&lt;/p&gt;
