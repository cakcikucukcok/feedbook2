&lt;br /&gt;
Jamie is a delicate literary genius whose withered legs compel him to rely on a wheelchair and crutches. Six years later, Pollyanna and her aunt fall upon hard times. Following the death of Dr. Chilton, as a means of making money, Pollyanna and her aunt are forced to take in the friends Pollyanna made six years earlier as boarders. However, there are many skeletons lurking in people&amp;#39;s closets, causing numerous misunderstandings and many revelations, including how old childhood friend Jimmy &amp;#39;Bean&amp;#39; Pendleton ended up alone." />
