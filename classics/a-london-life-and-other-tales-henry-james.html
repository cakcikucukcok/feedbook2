  <title>A London Life and Other Tales - Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Henry James surprises one with every work, even after years of reading him. Here in A London Life is the familiar calm omniscient anonymous narrative voice telling the story, but the story itself is full of hard things, emotional violence, and financial violence, and not just scaled to the era in which it takes place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henry James, OM, son of theologian Henry James Sr., brother of the philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James, was an American-born author, one of the founders and leaders of a school of realism in fiction. He spent much of his life in England and became a British subject shortly before his death. He is primarily known for a series of major novels in which he portrayed the encounter of America with Europe. His plots centered on personal relationships, the proper exercise of power in such relationships, and other moral questions. His method of writing from the point of view of a character within a tale allowed him to explore the phenomena of consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting." />
