      <meta name="description" content="IN JUST ONE year, Jack Knob has gone from being a young man beginning to realize his dreams to one whose desperate thoughts are aimed at helping his struggling family. Max Prentice, who has had his eye on Jack for sometime, is a successful toy-maker and the owner of a toy store in Chicago. Yet, when Jack&#39;s desperate thoughts begin to turn into action, Max intervenes, shows Jack the error in his thinking, and hires Jack to be his apprentice. Indeed, all is going well, until illness confines Max to bed and results in his wife Mildred running the store. With little remorse, her first act is to fire Jack. To learn what happens to Jack, Mildred, and even Max, turn the knob and enter the shop." />
