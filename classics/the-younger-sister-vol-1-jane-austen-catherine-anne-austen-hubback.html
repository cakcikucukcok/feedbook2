  <title>THE YOUNGER SISTER Vol 1 - Jane Austen, Catherine Anne Austen Hubback</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first volume (of three) in the completion of Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s series &amp;ldquo;THE WATSONS&amp;rdquo; by her niece Catherine Hubback-Watson.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Watson is a widowed clergyman with two sons and four daughters. The youngest daughter, Emma, has been brought up by a wealthy aunt and is consequently better educated and more refined than her sisters. But when her aunt contracts a foolish second marriage, Emma is obliged to return to her father&amp;#39;s house. There she is chagrined by the crude and reckless husband-hunting of two of her sisters. She finds the kindness of her eldest and most responsible sister, Elizabeth, more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Living near the Watsons are the Osbornes, a great titled family. Emma attracts some notice from the boorish and awkward young Lord Osborne, while one of her sisters pursues Lord Osborne&amp;#39;s arrogant, social-climbing friend, Tom Musgrave. Various minor characters provide potential matches for Emma&amp;#39;s brothers and sisters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Watson is seriously ill in the opening chapters, and Austen confided in her sister Cassandra that he was to die in the course of the work. Emma was to decline a marriage proposal from Lord Osborne, and was eventually to marry Osborne&amp;#39;s virtuous former tutor, Mr. Howard.&lt;br /&gt;
================&lt;br /&gt;
AUTHOR PROFILE: Catherine Anne Hubback (7 July 1818 &amp;ndash; 25 February 1877) was an English novelist, and the eighth child and fourth daughter of Sir Francis Austen (1774-1865), and niece of JANE AUSTEN.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She began writing fiction to support herself and her three sons after her husband John Hubback was institutionalized with a breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;
She had copies of some of her aunt&amp;#39;s unfinished works and, in 1850, remembering Austen&amp;#39;s proposed plot, she wrote The Younger Sister, a completion of Jane Austen&amp;#39;s THE WATSONS. In the next thirteen years, she completed nine more novels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She emigrated to California, USA in 1870. In the autumn of 1876 she removed to Gainesville, Prince William Co, VA, where she died in 1877." />
