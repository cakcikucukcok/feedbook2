&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;THE WHIRLIGIG OF LIFE&lt;/b&gt; (excerpt)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Justice-of-the-Peace Benaja Widdup sat in the door of his office smoking his elder-stem pipe. Half-way to the zenith the Cumberland range rose blue-gray in the afternoon haze. A speckled hen swaggered down the main street of the &amp;quot;settlement,&amp;quot; cackling foolishly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Up the road came a sound of creaking axles, and then a slow cloud of dust, and then a bull-cart bearing Ransie Bilbro and his wife. The cart stopped at the Justice&amp;#39;s door, and the two climbed down. Ransie was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair. The imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour. The woman was calicoed, angled, snuff-brushed, and weary with unknown desires. Through it all gleamed a faint protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Justice of the Peace slipped his feet into his shoes, for the sake of dignity, and moved to let them enter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We-all,&amp;quot; said the woman, in a voice like the wind blowing through pine boughs, &amp;quot;wants a divo&amp;#39;ce.&amp;quot; She looked at Ransie to see if he noted any flaw or ambiguity or evasion or partiality or self-partisanship in her statement of their business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A divo&amp;#39;ce,&amp;quot; repeated Ransie, with a solemn nod. &amp;quot;We-all can&amp;#39;t git along together nohow. It&amp;#39;s lonesome enough fur to live in the mount&amp;#39;ins when a man and a woman keers fur one another. But when she&amp;#39;s a-spittin&amp;#39; like a wildcat or a-sullenin&amp;#39; like a hoot-owl in the cabin, a man ain&amp;#39;t got no call to live with her.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;When he&amp;#39;s a no-&amp;#39;count varmint,&amp;quot; said the woman, &amp;quot;without any especial warmth, a-traipsin&amp;#39; along of scalawags and moonshiners and a-layin&amp;#39; on his back pizen &amp;#39;ith co&amp;#39;n whiskey, and a-pesterin&amp;#39; folks with a pack o&amp;#39; hungry, triflin&amp;#39; houn&amp;#39;s to feed!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;When she keeps a-throwin&amp;#39; skillet lids,&amp;quot; came Ransie&amp;#39;s antiphony, &amp;quot;and slings b&amp;#39;ilin&amp;#39; water on the best coon-dog in the Cumberlands, and sets herself agin&amp;#39; cookin&amp;#39; a man&amp;#39;s victuals, and keeps him awake o&amp;#39; nights accusin&amp;#39; him of a sight of doin&amp;#39;s!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;When he&amp;#39;s al&amp;#39;ays a-fightin&amp;#39; the revenues, and gits a hard name in the mount&amp;#39;ins fur a mean man, who&amp;#39;s gwine to be able fur to sleep o&amp;#39; nights?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Justice of the Peace stirred deliberately to his duties. He placed his one chair and a wooden stool for his petitioners. He opened his book of statutes on the table and scanned the index. Presently he wiped his spectacles and shifted his inkstand...&lt;br /&gt;

Comprised of 24 short stories, the book showcases darling and daring characters and developed plots that aptly display Henry's wit and ingeniousness....<br /><b><i>Whirligigs by O. Henry: Book Summary &amp; Quotes | Study.com</i></b> | Great title! [”Whirligigs” is O. Henry’s 10th book, released in 1910 – the year he died.] Apparently O. Henry never wrote a novel! (Though de Maupassant did.) He has a magnificent, erratic style I am tempted to call “operatic pulp”: “Hartley pressed the ‘McComus’ button. The door latch clicked spasmodically – now hospitably, now doubtfully, as though in anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or duns.<br /><b><i>Whirligigs by O.
