  <title>Explosive Engagement (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Lisa Childs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;GETTING MARRIED MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN COMPLETING HIS MISSION. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nothing has fazed Logan Payne in his entire career as a bodyguard. That is, until he&#39;s tasked with protecting his biggest enemy. Stacy Kozminski isn&#39;t too thrilled about having to work with Logan either, but when attempts are made on her life, she knows he is her only hope if she wants to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Soon, a target is placed on both their backs, and they have no choice but to stage an engagement to protect one another. Logan won&#39;t let Stacy out of his sight. But is it because he doesn&#39;t want to fail his assignment…or because he&#39;s come to care for the gutsy and gorgeous woman–the only woman who&#39;s ever gone toe-to-toe with him?&lt;/p&gt;
