  <title>The Sheriff of Silverhill (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Carol Ericson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The safety of Silverhill rested on Rafe McClintock&#39;s broad shoulders. Good-natured but hard-nosed, the sheriff kept the peace in Colorado with a shotgun and a smile. At least until Dana Croft crossed into his jurisdiction. She was here on FBI duty–a dead body on the rez–but after all these years Rafe could still put a hitch in her throat.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though a star was pinned to the rangy cowboy&#39;s chest, he didn&#39;t have authority over her heart. As they hunted a killer together, across the reservation and into uncharted territory, Dana&#39;s secret threatened to explode at any moment. But before Rafe could wrap her in his protection, would their reunion be cut short?&lt;/p&gt;
