  <title>Vathek - William Beckford, Thomas Keymer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Woe to the rash mortal who seeks to know that of which he should remain ignorant; and to undertake that which surpasseth his power!The Caliph Vathek is dissolute and debauched, and hungry for knowledge.  When the mysterious Giaour offers him boundless treasure and unrivalled power he is willing to sacrifice his god, the lives of innocent children, and his own soul to satisfy his obsession.  Vatheks extraordinary journey  to the subterranean palace of Eblis, and the terrifying fate that there awaits him, is a captivating tale of magic and oriental fantasy, sudden violence and corrupted love, whose mix of moral fable,grotesque comedy, and evocative beauty defies classification.  Originally written by Beckford in French at the age of only 21, its dreamlike qualities have influenced writers from Byron to H. P. Lovecraft.This new edition reprints Beckfords authorized English text of 1816 with its elaborate and entertaining notes.  In his new introduction Thomas Keymer examines the novels relations to a range of literary genres and cultural contexts. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford Worlds Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxfords commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more." />
