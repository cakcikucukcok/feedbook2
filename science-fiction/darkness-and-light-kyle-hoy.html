The pain upon Aurons mind of losing fifteen of his original twenty-four brave Omans was nearly unbearable. They spent hundreds of thousands cycles away from their home and finally returned to Sonos but came to understand something isnt adding up. Auron will not allow the existence of his people to come to an end and wishes to try and repeat the life cycle.
