  <title>Annihilation of a Planet - Antonion Borges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Humans have already built cities under the sea in the year 2222, and the bulging Earths population has nowhere to go but up.  To that end, 900 robots are engineered for the sole purpose of going to Mars and building the first city meant for human habitation in space.  At the last moment, the father of the project reconfigures a robot once created for elder-care.  Using his own DNA, the scientist designs robot Lawrence in his own image. 
Regardless of the advances man has made technologically, he has not advanced socially or morally.  Thugs still roam city streets, people still fight over religion and power, the haves still have little compassion for the have-nots.  Lawrences creator hopes the special robots presence on Mars will insure a different social climate on the new frontier.  But it is not to be.  The scientists nemesis has reconfigured some of the original robots to strike out on their own, their greatest impulse to destroy humankind.  
When the rebellious choose Lawrence to destroy humans by delivering a Mega-bomb to earth, Lawrence digresses, seeking first to continue the quest he set for himself when he was an elder-care specialist: finding the meaning of love. 
	Can love be found on a quarreling, hate-filled, war-torn, over crowded planet? Is it possible for love to be defined in the computer brain of a robot, tempting him to reconsider his mission? One planet will be annihilated in his science-fiction saga.  Which one? The answer has everything to do with the power of love." />
