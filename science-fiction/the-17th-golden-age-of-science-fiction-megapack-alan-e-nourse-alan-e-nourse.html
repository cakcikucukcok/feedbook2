  <title>The 17th Golden Age of Science Fiction MEGAPACK ®: Alan E. Nourse - Alan E. Nourse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;The Golden Age of Science Fiction&lt;\B&gt; MEGAPACK™ series showcases great science fiction authors whose work might otherwise be forgotten. This time we focus on Alan E. Nourse, medical doctor and science fiction author, who paid his way through med school with his writing. He may be most famous as the author whose title was &quot;borrowed&quot; for the movie Bladerunner...though the movie was based on Philip K. Dick&#39;s &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; Nourse published just a handful of novels in addition to his magazine stories, but he was well regarded at the time, and his work has stood up well. We are delighted to include no less than 22 of his classic tales in this volume. Here are:&lt;P&gt; MARLEY&#39;S CHAIN&lt;BR&gt; CONSIGNMENT&lt;BR&gt; DERELICT&lt;BR&gt; INFINITE INTRUDER&lt;BR&gt; LETTER OF THE LAW&lt;BR&gt; BRIGHTSIDE CROSSING &lt;BR&gt; PRoblem&lt;BR&gt; BEAR TRAP&lt;BR&gt; THE COFFIN CURE&lt;BR&gt; MARTYR&lt;BR&gt; THE NATIVE SOIL&lt;BR&gt; CONTAMINATION CREW&lt;BR&gt; GOLD IN THE SKY&lt;BR&gt; STAR SURGEON&lt;BR&gt; AN OUNCE OF CURE&lt;BR&gt; CIRCUS&lt;BR&gt; THE DARK DOOR&lt;BR&gt; IMAGE OF THE GODS&lt;BR&gt; MEETING OF THE BOARD&lt;BR&gt; MY FRIEND BOBBY&lt;BR&gt; SECOND SIGHT&lt;BR&gt; THE LINK&lt;P&gt; If you enjoy this book, search your favorite ebook store for &quot;Wildside Press Megapack&quot; to see the 200+ other entries in the series, covering mysteries, science fiction, modern authors, westerns, classics, adventure stories, and much, much more!" />
