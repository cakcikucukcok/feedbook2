  <title>Orion Rising - Leonard O’Neill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the remote past, evidence was left behind, documented, written down, painted on cave walls and in paintings throughout time. Evidence that was ignored by the mainstream academics. Some would see this evidence and ask about it, only to be ridiculed for it.
Let me put this idea into perspective for you.
Socrates, a philosopher of great stature even to this day, was forced to drink poison and take his own life because he openly said that the earth was not flat! It was and had to be round! He was put to death for this way of thinking, let alone outright saying it. So you see, it is not just something so small as to say aliens are real at any time in history on this planet! One could be put to death for much less. The motto of most military pilots, some commercial to this day, is If you talk about UFOs or say UFO, the only thing you will be flying is a desk!
So this, as you can see, has kept many people from saying anything. In fact, if you asked the average American in 1975 if they believed in UFOs, the percent was 10 percent. It has taken until now in 2016 to get that number up to 58 percent, in large part thanks to the men and women that have dedicated there lives to this cause.
Do you believe in aliens or not? I ask this to everyone. What if it is true? What if it all was true? What if aliens did come to Earth? What if they are still here? What if a couple of people stumbled on it?" />
