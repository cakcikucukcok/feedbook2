The future of the world is tethered on egos, organized crime will test the limits of the ability to control mankind, and nations are getting tangled in an eye for an eye way of life. The Biker culture is holding strong to their counterfeiting and barter trades which defy C.O.N.U.S at ever turn as their confederation gathers momentum! All of Heaven&#39;s creations are under the command of one man and his elite group of Paladins! Join Ace in unlocking the mysteries of his journey and finding where his true path lies, in this first installment of nine, in which he will be taking you on an unforgettable Religious Science Fiction Adventure!" />
