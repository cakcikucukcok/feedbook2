      <meta name="description" content="Four individuals from different worlds face certain death. A gunfighter is cornered after being hunted by a band of vicious warriors. An assassin is to be sacrificed via electric crucifixion. A swordsmen fights to the death in an arena of futuristic blood sport. And, Alex, a teenager from our world is pushed under a speeding car. All four are saved at the instant before death in a whiff of red mist. When they awake they find themselves in the realm of the techno-mage Kyrinn, and find also there is a price for his intervention. They have been rescued only to be sent on a suicidal mission to save his only heir from an unknown foe in a terrible world made up of stolen lands. Either agree to the techno-mage&#39;s terms or be returned to the exact moment before their deaths. With no other choice the four strangers accept, but first they must go to Alex&#39;s great city where the only known portal to the secret realm exists, itself a terrifying deathtrap, and this is just the beginning." />
