  <title>The Swirling Lights of Paradise - Bryan Whelan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the life-and-death struggle of one spineless librarian thrust into the dangerous world that was opened up by the swirling light. Would his true self be the salvation or the death of him? 
Poor Harold Manning, his life was just one boring day after another. The love of his life, his coworker at the library, barely took any notice of him. He was destined to die a lonely single man too afraid to take a chance on life. But, one fateful weekend, he encountered the swirling light. He was transported to a place where survival was paramount. Every day he struggled against the elements, strange beasts, and things from the past and future. Along the way he developed friendships with the oddest people, who had also been transported to the same place. Each new person had been plucked from a different time period. It was a complete mystery as to where they were, when they were, or even why they were there at all. 
Each new crisis that confronted the strange band of friends meant either death or survival. Through all this, Harolds true mettle was tested. Was Harold up for the challenge, or was he going to cower away like the timid little librarian he was? And just who was controlling this whole place anyway?
This is a fantastic tale of how one mild-mannered man with his odd band of friends battled the strange world that was opened up by the swirling lights." />
