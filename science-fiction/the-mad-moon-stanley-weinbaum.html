  <title>The Mad Moon - Stanley Weinbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;IDIOTS!&amp;quot; howled Grant Calthorpe. &amp;quot;Fools&amp;mdash;nitwits&amp;mdash;imbeciles!&amp;quot; He sought wildly for some more expressive terms, failed and vented his exasperation in a vicious kick at the pile of rubbish on the ground. Too vicious a kick, in fact; he had again forgotten the one-third normal gravitation of Io, and his whole body followed his kick in a long, twelve-foot arc. As he struck the ground the four loonies giggled. Their great, idiotic heads, looking like nothing so much as the comic faces painted on Sunday balloons for children, swayed in unison on their five-foot necks, as thin as Grant&amp;#39;s wrist. &amp;quot;Get out!&amp;quot; he blazed, scrambling erect. &amp;quot;Beat it, skiddoo, scram! No chocolate. No candy. Not until you learn that I want ferva leaves, and not any junk you happen to grab. Clear out!&amp;quot; The loonies&amp;mdash; Lunae Jovis Magnicapites, or literally, Bigheads of Jupiter&amp;#39;s Moon&amp;mdash;backed away, giggling plaintively. Beyond doubt, they considered Grant fully as idiotic as he considered them, and were quite unable to understand the reasons for his anger. But they certainly realized that no candy was to be forthcoming, and their giggles took on a note of keen disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;
So keen, indeed, that the leader, after twisting his ridiculous blue face in an imbecilic grin at Grant, voiced a last wild giggle and dashed his head against a glittering stone-bark tree. His companions casually picked up his body and moved off, with his head dragging behind them on its neck like a prisoner&amp;#39;s ball on a chain.&lt;br /&gt;
Grant brushed his hand across his forehead and turned wearily toward his stone-bark log shack. A pair of tiny, glittering red eyes caught his attention, and a slinker&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Mus Sapiens&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;skipped his six-inch form across the threshold, bearing under his tiny, skinny arm what looked very much like Grant&amp;#39;s clinical thermometer.&lt;br /&gt;
Grant yelled angrily at the creature, seized a stone, and flung it vainly. At the edge of the brush, the slinker turned its ratlike, semihuman face toward him, squeaked its thin gibberish, shook a microscopic fist in manlike wrath, and vanished, its batlike cowl of skin fluttering like a cloak. It looked, indeed, very much like a black rat wearing a cape.&lt;br /&gt;
It had been a mistake, Grant knew, to throw the stone at it. Now the tiny fiends would never permit him any peace, and their diminutive size and pseudo-human intelligence made them infernally troublesome as enemies. Yet, neither that reflection nor the loony&amp;#39;s suicide troubled him particularly; he had witnessed instances like the latter too often, and besides, his head felt as if he were in for another siege of white fever." />
