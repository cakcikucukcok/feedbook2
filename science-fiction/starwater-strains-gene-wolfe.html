  <title>Starwater Strains - Gene Wolfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gene Wolfe follows his acclaimed all-fantasy short story collection, &lt;i&gt;Innocents Aboard&lt;/i&gt;, with a volume devoted primarily to his science fiction. The twenty-five stories here amply demonstrate his range, excellence, and mastery of the form that has traditionally been the heart of the field. Their diversity makes them otherwise impossible to characterize as a group, so a few tantalizing samples will have to suffice: &lt;br&gt;&quot;Viewpoint&quot; takes on the unreality of so-called &quot;reality&quot; TV and imagines such a show done truly for real, with real guns, and a real government clawing at the money. Wolfe has loved dinosaurs since he was kid, and in &quot;Petting Zoo&quot; he imagines the reunion of a man and an aged dinosaur  who look back together on a day when they were much much younger, and much freer. &quot;Empires of Foliage and Flower&quot; is a special treat, an addition to the classic Book of the New Sun series first published only as a limited edition chapbook. The volume closes with its newest story &quot;Golden City Far.&quot; It&#39;s about dreams, high school, and finding love, which Wolfe says &quot;is about as good a recipe for a story as I&#39;ve ever found.&quot; You&#39;re sure to agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
