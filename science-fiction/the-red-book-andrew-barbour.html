In increasing clarity, these books show first the preparation and then the arrival in the first bookwhich, I freely admit, is not easy to read. But any change that I made, made it nearly impossible to continue until I reversed the change that I had made. &lt;/p&gt;
It was realised that things had to be effectively translated. This is what led to the creation of The Red Book. So using what I had learned and figured out, I applied the same technique to a digital camera, and the results speak for themselves." />
