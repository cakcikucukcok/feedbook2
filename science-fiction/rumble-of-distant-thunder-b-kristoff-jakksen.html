  <title>Rumble of Distant Thunder - B. Kristoff Jakksen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Our young people are dying, constantly being murdered by senseless acts of violence. They are dying in unprecedented numbersnot on the battleground of foreign landsbut in the schoolsand on the streets of their very own cities.&lt;P&gt;RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER is a story born out of love and compassion for these children. For already in the distance an ominous cloud has formed forecasting destruction, wars, and global famine for their future. No one seems to care enough and so, they are become the forgotten ones. Violence is robbing our youth of the simplicity of pleasure, their childhood. &lt;P&gt;RUMBLE paves a way from such gloom that threatens to destroy our children and our society. It teaches self-respect and the value of human life.&lt;P&gt;Within the first chapters, you will meet SOJOURNER, a star-ship that is one of the principal characters. Its primary function is to travel the galaxies, while monitoring the &quot;Chosen Ones&quot; stationed throughout the universe. &lt;P&gt;You will meet Darius; a seventeen-year-old inner?city youth who is forced to ward off everyday events that threatens his survival.&lt;P&gt;Through a series of events and prophecies, he learns that there is a special call on his lifeand an inescapable destiny.&lt;P&gt;Young Darius and his friends have seen the results of living in such a violent and moralless society. He has seen childhood friends senselessly gunned down, others trying to escape by way of drugs, leaving to mourn their shattered lives friends and loved ones. Darius is troubled and saddened by all that is happening around him. Powerless to do anything about it for the moment, he pledges that somehow, he WILL make a difference.&lt;P&gt;The unsuspecting youth learns through an age?old prophecy that he is a prince and direct descendant of the Wantu?Wazuri, a supremely advanced race that had once visited our world over twelve thousand years ago. In their observation of human development, they were overwhelmed with concern for the children they were to leave behind. Upon their departure, they endowed the lives of these children with positive effects and indelible marks of more advanced and intelligent civilizations. Unbeknownst to Darius the prophecy is unfolding itself. Elsewhere in the Universe, the Council of Elders are convening and collectively using their telepathic powers to summon and prepare him for the leadership of his people.&lt;P&gt;As Darius appointed time draws near, he begins to speak out of love and self?respect to all that will listen, while Jamaal, a young, ruthless killer, and leader of a powerful drug?gang, is determined to protect his own interests. The escalating violence surrounding him continues to fill Darius with questions as he struggles to understand why, and the call on his life.&lt;P&gt;Through Ganna, his spiritual guardian and mentor, Darius knows he must accept his fate. The decision to leave Earth even temporarily is tough, but he knows that if his world is to survive at all, he must go.&lt;P&gt;Arriving with his family and some of his closest friends on Wantu?Wazuria, the Central Seat of government for the vast, expanding empire, the struggle intensifies as Efuru, the evil and manipulating wife of the late Emperor Nkombe?the?Great, attempts to thwart his ascension to the throne.&lt;P&gt;This humble, yet lion?hearted youth learns that for the last five hundred years, the Wantu?Wazurians were peaceful and prosperous people. Now, after the Emperors death, his wife fights to have her evil and treacherous son rule, despite the prophecies that the throne would be torn from her grasps and given to an off?worlder.&lt;P&gt;Ignoring the ancient prophecies, Efuru continues her campaign for her sons rights against the Will of God and the Council of Elders who had refused to reinstate him honoring the request of his father on his deathbed.&lt;P&gt;Prince Naamesis, extremely bitter over that decision, rebels and leads a revolt against Darius.
