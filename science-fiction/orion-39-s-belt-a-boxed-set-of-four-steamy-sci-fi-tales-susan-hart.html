  <title>Orion&#39;s Belt - a Boxed Set of Four Steamy Sci Fi Tales - Susan Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Population Control, is a steamy sci-fi romance short story set ten years after an alien invasion, where the aliens need to repopulate the earth, but under their set of controlled circumstances.   The Alien In The Diner, is about a waitress working in an all-night diner near Roswell, New Mexico.  She&#39;s used to the locals and an assortment of drifters who frequent the place, but definitely not used to the charismatic stranger who stops in one night for a bite to eat.   Notes From Heaven, is an innovative and romantic thriller novella set in the near future, and one which explores the &#39;what ifs&#39; of cloning human beings; and ones that were incredible and unique geniuses when they first lived on the earth.  Chasing The T-Rex Back Into Time, is a unique steamy adult romance involving two paleontologists at a university, a rampaging T-Rex about to pop back into a wormhole which formed on university property, and a desire to really experience what it would be like to watch two dinosaurs mating." />
