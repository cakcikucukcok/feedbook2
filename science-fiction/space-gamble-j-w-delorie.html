      <meta name="description" content="Operator Furgis is critically injured while inspecting the Mortelis refit of the ships drafted into the new Western fleet. As Dr. Avers works to save his life, Sam finds a vid recording of the logs his father recorded during his younger years before Neptune One. As Sam initiates the recording through the vid com, his consciousness is pulled into the recording, he soon realizes that he has become his father through the vid com. While his father battles for his life, Sam cannot resist reliving the early years of his father. His love and empathy grows stronger towards his father as he witnesses firsthand the struggles of young Kennith Furgis, the troubles of a young teenager that was coerced into the Western Empires space fleet. Sam learns of the day his father first noticed his mother Raynor Caso during boot camp through his first assignment with Commander Drake. Sam now understands the meaning of family through his fathers eyes as he meets the different individuals that now are strong in his life, and understands the Tribulations his father and close friends have experienced." />
