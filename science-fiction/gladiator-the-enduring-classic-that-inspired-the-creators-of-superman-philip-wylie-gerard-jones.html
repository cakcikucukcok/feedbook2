  <title>Gladiator: The Enduring Classic That Inspired the Creators of Superman! - Philip Wylie, Gerard Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thanks to his father&#39;s genetic experiments, Hugo Danner is born with superhuman levels of strength, speed, and intelligence. Hugo feels compelled to conceal his gifts from a suspicious and uncomprehending world, but he doesn&#39;t take on an identity as a costumed crusader. Instead, his struggles to find a place in society that will accommodate his extraordinary skills lead to a checkered career as a boardwalk strongman, Foreign Legionnaire, politician, and archeologist. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Gladiator,&lt;/I&gt; first published in 1930, preceded Superman&#39;s debut by eight years and formed the archetypes further developed in subsequent superhero comics and literature. Fans of comics, graphic novels, science-fiction, and fantasy literature will be captivated by this timeless tale of an outsider&#39;s search for acceptance and fulfillment. Introduction by Gerard Jones, author of &lt;I&gt;Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book. &lt;/I&gt;" />
