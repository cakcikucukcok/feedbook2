  <title>From the Annals of the Trust - Myron Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Gospel Probe&lt;/i&gt;, the first book from which the series takes its name, exploits the newly discovered capacity to travel in time by the Institute of Temporal Research, the ITR. The protagonists were forced by feuding Christian factions to return to the past to verify or discount the veracity of the Gospels. It was found that there were significant differences between what actually happened and that recorded. Equally important was the surprise discovery of an agent, Francois LeBrust, from another timeline sent to alter the course of history by injecting a new morality in the name of his sponsor, The Trust for the Fusion of Science and the Spirit. The second book, The Romp of Lebrust, takes the time trippers to Rome in the time of St Paul where they again encounter Francois LeBrust still working to promote the values of the Trust by shoring up the faith. Rumors of the achievements of the ITR attracted the attention of Carlen Bromfsted, Chief of Intelligence of the US Army. The current title takes up where it left off.&lt;/p&gt;" />
