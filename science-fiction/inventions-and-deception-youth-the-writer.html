  <title>Inventions and Deception - Youth the Writer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cases of stigmata, weeping and bleeding icons, the mystifying Shroud of Turin and the Marian
Apparitions; all of which are just a fraction of thousands of reported religious miracles. The scientifi c
seeks for rational explanations while the faithful accepts them without doubt and hesitation. Penning
one fi ne piece of work after the other under a pseudonym, Youth the Writer continues to englighten the
modern man with his groundbreaking philosophical series of books. This time around, he sheds light to
the hidden affair behind religiious miracles in Inventions and Deception, the seventh in the series.
Like all the other six installments, Inventions and Deception follows the conversation, taking place via
the authors dreams, between the Professor and Ace. These two beings live in two different times and
places but regularly meet to discuss everything there is know about life and its inner workings through
the Accelerating Life, an intensive education course that will make each student wiser; allowing them
to learn from eighty-eight life experiences in very short time.
Through a series of penetrating questions and incisive responses between instructor and student,
Inventions and Deception posits that inventions, in the beginning, has become an excellent marketing
tool for ancient temples. This early inventors needed support to continue experimenting, and some
of them asked the temples masters for such support in exchange it will be displayed in the temples
where people can come and see it. The temple masters quickly found out that the people thought of
such invention as Gods work, and they were telling other people about it to visit. The temple masters
started to invest more in the inventors for exclusive right of the inventions as well as confi dentiality
of the project.
Soon, greed led the temple masters to kill some of the inventors to make sure that no other temple will
have what they have. It was greed and ugliness that made some of the inventors run away and think of
the truth of the temple.Some of those inventors become the fi rst unbelievers, and some of them even
started a hidden war against the temples. Inventions, later on, become a tool to uncover deception.
Youth the Writer has certainly concocted an intelligent read in Inventions and Deception. Apart from
discussing how men were deceived to believing the supposedly miracles by the divine and otherworldly,
Youth the Writer also tackles polemical issues such as revolutions, political parties, marriage, and good
versus evil. The reader is invited and encouraged to think more than the usual and question what has
been thought to be true since the world began." />
