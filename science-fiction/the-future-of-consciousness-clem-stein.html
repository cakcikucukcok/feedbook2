  <title>The Future of Consciousness - Clem Stein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;Imagine theres no heaven&lt;br&gt;
Its easy if you try&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;No hell below us&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above us only sky&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Imagine all the people&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Living for today...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;-From Imagine, by John Lennon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the year 2258, religions, or life reward systems (LRS), were
totally discredited. All of the myths, miracles, and magic had been
disproved. The worlds population, with a few exceptions, believed
that it was nonsense to say In God we trust or God bless
America in what was left of the United States. Even the immense
power blocks of China and India, the leading world powers, had given
up deities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a normal book foreword; it is a fast forward. We need to
fast forward about three hundred years into the future and not look
at the past, which of course would be a fast rewind. The signs leading
to the assumptions made by this book, when it deals with the future,
are everywhere to be seen today. However, the situation is that
most people wont or cant see too far beyond the end of their nose.
They incorrectly assume that everyone believes what they believe
and not too often question the path they take, as most people desire
the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
