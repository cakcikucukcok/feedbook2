  <title>The Guardians - F. Thomas Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Tirgonian Empire, always on the hunt for conquest and expansion, does not consider the efforts of the rebel Guardians a serious threat to their imperial plans. After a series of devastating conflicts, the Guardians have suffered massive losses to their forces but not their resolve. They continue to fight their way into Tirgonian territory, undaunted by defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the Guardians are focused on escaping the Tirgonian forces, commanded by Telecoup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mular, tension mounts between several of the Guardian survivors. The few remaining Guardians are bolstered by the arrival of additional survivors, but the initial contact does not go smoothly. The survivors arrive on a new sort of spaceship, one that the Guardians have never seen. Once the Guardians realize their mistakes, it is revealed that there are more concealed ships, hopefully increasing their chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardians must now invent unique solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems. The unexpected defection of a senior Tirgonian officer named Telebisque Serligh Teka, his entire crew, and their Fighting Star Palup is a welcome boost to the weary rebel effort. Renewed, the Guardians continue fighting their way across enemy territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against seemingly insurmountable odds, can the Guardians prevail? And if so, at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;" />
