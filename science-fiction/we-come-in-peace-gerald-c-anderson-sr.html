  <title>We Come in Peace - Gerald C. Anderson Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As repentance for all the evil it inflicted, the people of Gomorrah have been banished to another world for the last 5,000 years. King Abimelech and his followers are now ready to return to AdaminaEarthand regain what they believe is rightfully theirs. The king commissioned Professor Hai to locate the distant Adamina in order to facilitate Gomorrahs return and to crush Adaminas current inhabitants. 
As the chief scientist of both the University of Brisha and the Adamina Research Project, Hai holds the key to Gomorrahs return. But Hai maintains another important role as the leader of the resistance, a small group of Gomorrahans intent on overthrowing the king and returning peacefully to Adamina. Without the kings knowledge, Hai has located the planet and has built a three-person shuttle; he plans to warn Adamina about the kings impending attack.
But spies lurk everywhere on Gomorrah, and the resistance does not know who it can trust. When the king suspects that Hai is hiding something, the resistance knows it must hasten its plans for the overthrow of the government and travel to Adamina before it is too late." />
