  <title>When the Hammer Falls - Julian Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would you do if you had unlimited wishes? More to the point; what would you do if you were 12 years old and you discovered that you had unlimited wishes?
Jack was blissfully unaware of his pact with the devil and his ability to wish for whatever he wanted. Not knowing could be catastrophic, but knowing could not only be life-changing, it could also destroy everyone he loves and all of mankind.
Jack had escaped from the Malorians but their nanotechnology could track him back to Earth. Meanwhile, Jack met a troublesome girl called Megan who also had never-ending wishes. As Jack grew up he became the most successful and recognised man on the planet. Together they travelled through time and space, sometimes with disastrous results.
Throughout his life, Jacks guardian angel had saved him as the devil attempted to kill him. What could possibly go wrong? Who would be the first to kill him; the devil, the Malorians or would he kill himself?
His mother was kidnapped and he was told to kill Perry Green or she would die. Would Jack kill him or would a bomb onboard a Boeing 747 kill him and 329 others.
Ive got news for you buddy; theres worse things than dying." />
