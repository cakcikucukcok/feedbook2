  <title>Probability Space - Nancy Kress</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nancy Kress cemented her reputation in SF with the publication of her multiple-award-winning novella, &quot;Beggars in Spain,&quot; which became the basis for her extremely successful Beggars Trilogy (comprising &lt;i&gt;Beggars in Spain, Beggars and Choosers, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Beggars Ride&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now she brings us &lt;i&gt;Probability Space&lt;/i&gt;, the conclusion of the trilogy that began with &lt;i&gt;Probability Moon&lt;/i&gt; and then &lt;i&gt;Probability Sun&lt;/i&gt;, which is centered on the same world as Kress&#39;s Nebula Award-winning novelette, &quot;Flowers of Aulit Prison.&quot; The Probability Trilogy has already been widely recognized as the next great work by this important SF writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Probability Space&lt;/i&gt;, humanity&#39;s war with the alien Fallers continues, and it is a war we are losing. Our implacable foes ignore all attempts at communication, and they take no prisoners. Our only hope lies with an unlikely coalition: Major Lyle Kaufman, retired warrior; Marbet Grant, the Sensitive who&#39;s involved with Kaufman; Amanda, a very confused fourteen-year-old girl; and Magdalena, one of the biggest power brokers in all of human space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the action moves from Earth to Mars to the farthest reaches of known space, with civil unrest back home and alien war in deep space, four humans--armed with little more than an unproven theory--try to enter the Fallers&#39; home star system. It&#39;s a desperate gamble, and the fate of the entire universe may hang in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
