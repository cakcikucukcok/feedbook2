Many of these characters live in a utopian future of instant connection and technological gratification that belies an unbridgeable human distance, while others inhabit a post-collapse landscape made primitive by disaster, which they must work to rebuild as we once did millennia ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;The Cartographers,&quot; the main character works for a company that creates and sells virtual memories, while struggling to maintain a real-world relationship sabotaged by an addiction to his own creations. In &quot;Saying Goodbye to Yang,&quot; the robotic brother of an adopted Chinese child malfunctions, and only in his absence does the family realize how real a son he has become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Children of the New World &lt;/i&gt;grapples with our unease in this modern world and how our ever-growing dependence on new technologies has changed the shape of our society. Alexander Weinstein is a visionary new voice in speculative fiction for all of us who are fascinated by and terrified of what we might find on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
