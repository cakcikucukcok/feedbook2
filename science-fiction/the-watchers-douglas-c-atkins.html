  <title>The Watchers - Douglas C. Atkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of years ago, deep within an ancient Jewish religious work, the details of a prophesied judgment day are revealed. Written in 300 BC, the book of Enoch holds the truth for the future. The world needs to know the reality, but one question remainswho will spread the word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long after the turn of the twenty-first century, water and oxygen are in short supply. With nearly all the natural resources depleted, a megacompany controls the insatiable demand for water and oxygen through its international desalination plants. But when the companys network administrator discovers someone is sending out classified security information about the plants, he has no idea that it is all part of a plot hatched by the Church of the Elect. Its leader, Shaul Eitan, is determined to carry out a plan to destroy all the desalination plants and, worse yet, to initiate a nuclear holocaust. Eitan wants nothing more than to destroy the human population forever. The Watchers have no choicethey must risk everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaos reigns in a future dystopian world as everyone wonders if the book of Enoch has foretold a truthful ending to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
