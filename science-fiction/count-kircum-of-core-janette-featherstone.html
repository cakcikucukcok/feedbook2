      <meta name="description" content="What about the possibilities of entering into another dimension? Suddenly crashing sounds and glass breaking could be heard as a human cry was released, Noooo! Katharines hesitation was due to her unsure answer for she realized that she had entered into what might be a dangerous situation. She could not see Professor Brand and she knew she had heard him talking only a few minutes ago. Katharine ran for what seemed hours yet only minutes had passed. Shining before her was a moonlit path. As she glanced up the breathtaking view brought a chill to her soul. Before her, bright and round in shape were two, not one, but two beautiful moons high in the sky. Fear overcame her whole body and her legs seemed to now move in slow motion as those behind her could be heard coming closer." />
