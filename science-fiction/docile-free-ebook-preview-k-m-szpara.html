There is no consent under capitalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Docile &lt;/i&gt;is a science fiction parable about love and sex, wealth and debt, abuse and power, a challenging tour de force that at turns seduces and startles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be a Docile is to be kept, body and soul, for the uses of the owner of your contract. To be a Docile is to forget, to disappear, to hide inside your body from the horrors of your service. To be a Docile is to sell yourself to pay your parents&#39; debts and buy your children&#39;s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elisha Wilder&#39;s family has been ruined by debt, handed down to them from previous generations. His mother never recovered from the Dociline she took during her term as a Docile, so when Elisha decides to try and erase the family&#39;s debt himself, he swears he will never take the drug that took his mother from him. Too bad his contract has been purchased by Alexander Bishop III, whose ultra-rich family is the brains (and money) behind Dociline and the entire Office of Debt Resolution. When Elisha refuses Dociline, Alex refuses to believe that his family&#39;s crowning achievement could have any negative side effects--and is determined to turn Elisha into the perfect Docile without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
