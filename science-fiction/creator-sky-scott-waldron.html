      <meta name="description" content="The future looks exceedingly appealing. Humans are not restricted to the confines of Earth, and the power needed to keep us flourishing is amply available thanks to Solgen stations tethered to Earth. Everything is provided for by the Government. Each person has their purpose in life well defined by the analysis of genetics and behavior starting immediately after birth, and throughout the mandatory schooling period. Sky Smith&#39;s role in society is that of a citizen producer. He can&#39;t sit around and consume content like the average citizen, because rules for creators require success over everything else. Abruptly, Sky receives a new contract to document and report on Government run facilities that are rarely allowed citizen access. He takes up the opportunity because he knows that it is extremely rare and profitable, but it comes with risks both seen and unseen. Change is coming whether the Government will accept it or not, and Sky is in the middle of it." />
