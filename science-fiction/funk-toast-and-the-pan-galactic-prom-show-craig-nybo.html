  <title>Funk Toast and the Pan-Galactic Prom Show - Craig Nybo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Death, Resurrection, and Rock and Roll. Book 2 in the Pan-Galactic Prom Show duology. Hundreds of alien creatures gather at the Collundrome, an asteroid party venue, for the Pan-Galactic Prom Show, the biggest bash in the known universe. Funk Toast, an Earth band, is slated to headline the event. But Knolar Jex, intergalactic pirate and terrorist, has his own nefarious plans for this year&#39;s extravaganza. Meanwhile...Twana Burch and a few friends bring a cloned version of Bieber--the assassinated intergalactic pop idol--to the party with the intention of putting him on stage before the Prom Show audience. With enough media attention, Twana hopes to resurrect Bieber&#39;s career and rekindle the hearts of millions of teenage fans. Meanwhile...A special detachment of Ice Beetle soldiers from planet Hull also have their eyes on the Pan-Galactic Prom Show stage. Having left their planet at war and fearing the extinction of their species, they hope to solicit aid to their planet by delivering news of their ominous plight in the form of a rock and roll show." />
