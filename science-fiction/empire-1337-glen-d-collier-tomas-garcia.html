  <title>Empire 1337 - Glen D. Collier, Tomas Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Andrayn year 2381 the leaders of all 241 habitable planets came together in a great convention to combine their resources to solve their problems, and to discuss reform proposals.  Instead it brought chaos and war!  Forth came great alliances, and when war finally broke out all 241 systems had allied with either the Andrayns of Andrayos, or the Demurans of Demura.
The Lumen had the largest military force in the known systems.  When the war ended two powers, The Lumen and the Andrayns, would equally divide the territories and wealth.  The systems however would be governed by an Empire, with a Lumen Emperor.  The Andrayns agreed to their terms, and both signed all documents stipulating the terms of their alliance.
The war lasted a hundred years with the loss of 231 races.  Nearing the end of the war the Andrayns betrayed the Lumen.  They promised Blitten, Phorokian leaders power and wealth in the new Empire, only if they assisted them in the elimination of all remaining Lumen, the two accepted the terms.  There were no known Lumen survivors in space or on the Lumen planet Luma.
To date the Andrayn Empire governs all known systems and inhabitants.  The Demurans and the Ryloqians escaped into uncharted space at the end of the war, vowing vengeance and to return one day.  They did return but it was 1337 years later, calling themselves &quot;The Army of the Prime Light,&quot; or &quot;The Prime&quot; for short." />
