  <title>The Sewer Boy - Carol Mingst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Air, land, . . . and sewer? 
Exiled for centuries to a primitive planet, the people of Aerros have learned to live without animals or higher technology but using their genetically engineered plants, cultures, and Wing cousins to survive instead. Over time, they improved the Wings, from flying idiots to a productive serving class. But there are some places that feathered appendages just wont fit. The humans who handle these less-than-pleasant tasks are provided extra assistance and special privileges to make up for such work.
Pete is just a boy, but hes quick and agile and can get into all of those tight spaces to help his father maintain the sewers, but he could do without the older apprentices hazing.
Left in the dark, filthy tunnels by his fathers apprentice, Pete is rescued by Jared, a unique descendant of both human and Wing. This chance intervention sets Pete, Jared, and their friends on a path that will eventually bring the true problem of the settlement to light." />
