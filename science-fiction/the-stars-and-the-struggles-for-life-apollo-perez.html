  <title>The Stars and the Struggles for Life - Apollo Perez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New life started in a Distant Solar System and an Idea started with a Chosen One.      A Person Possessing Great Insight and Supernatural Powers and Could Solve Many Mysteries. Time passed and Generations would pass before the right person would take this idea to heart, Friendships and Missguided Leaders would almost destroy this New Life and Direction. It would take the Power of The Great Grandson of a Chosen One to keep this New Life Together and Going.
            This was a time when moving on a Planetary Scale to a new Planet in a New System just beyond the Great Nebula was planned. Their world here was to be destroyed by Massive Impacts as well as the Worlds near by. Such a Massive move would require Great Minds to come together and plan the move Precisely. Special people started to step up, seemingly coming from nowhere. Such a special person was well known and was considered to be a Chosen One. 
	This person was an accomplished Pilot and expert navigator and engineer and always coming up with new ideas. The move was well planned and executed and the trip and move was done. New life started in the New Worlds and this Pilot became known to the people as a Great inventer and builder of The Great Cities.
	As life expanded in the first of five planets, life seemed to flourish and expansion was promissing, he had an idea that would change the path into the Future.  Generations later, certain attitudes and poor plannings and personal goals would almost destroy these peoples futures and directions and it would take his Great Grandson to take control of life and destinies. His personal struggles early in his life in setting his direction and working with his friends was challenging. His close friends were mixed with their own paths and his personal love one was torn between him and loyalty to friends. Her direction and path would put a strain in his direction and destiny as he faced many challenges and adventures in his push through the Planets. 											Being among The Stars And The Struggle For Life is a challenge to this Chosen One and would change the total direction of many people and set many directions to A Common True Path And Future." />
