  <title>Iron Rage - James Axler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;DESPERATE MEASURES&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since the nukecaust, the American dream has been reduced to a daily fight for survival. In the hellish landscape of Deathlands, few dare to dream of a better tomorrow. But Ryan Cawdor and his companions press on, driven by the need for a future less treacherous than the present.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CAUGHT IN THE CROSS FIRE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pulling sec duty aboard a steamboat on the mighty Sippi is a welcome reprieve for Ryan and his friends…until armored warships reduce their vessel to a burning husk. Abruptly stranded in a nightmarish, poisonous swamp, fighting off crocodiles and muties, the companions and their crew of allies get to work building rafts. Their escape route, however, is swiftly intercepted, and they learn they&#39;ve sailed into the middle of a fierce conflict between two villes fighting over the iron trade. The companions don&#39;t seem to stand a chance against the fleets of ironclad gunboats. But in Deathlands, even the underdog can bite back…&lt;/p&gt;
