  <title>Ashlesha - Jer Keene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rex Tjin&amp;rsquo;s life has never been normal. It just took him a while to notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every kid spent their summer vacations learning survival tactics on paintball fields in rural Pennsylvania, could fieldstrip a .9mm and slap it back together at military-accepted speed, or had really good instincts for just &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; things&amp;mdash;including when to get out of the line of fire. (Most of the time.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Rex finally realized his family was different from his friends and neighbors in Kutztown, he didn&amp;rsquo;t care. He&amp;rsquo;s the third of eight kids who are all crazy, and they drive each other nuts, but they love each other. To every single one of them, that&amp;rsquo;s the most important part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four of them go into the military, thinking long-term careers. Then Rex&amp;rsquo;s younger brother dies in Iraq in 2005. It&amp;rsquo;s a disaster that isn&amp;rsquo;t his fault, but a loss he can&amp;rsquo;t stop blaming himself for. He bows out after only eight years instead of the planned twenty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rex spends the next decade trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life. He attends a college he can&amp;rsquo;t remember graduating from. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know if he collected a diploma. Rex didn&amp;rsquo;t care; school was something to fill the empty spaces in his life left behind by a lost sibling and the mental inertia of leaving the intensity of Special Forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking up available contracting work through the Department of Defense starts to fill those empty spaces nicely. Rex has a conscience and the ability to say &amp;ldquo;No thanks&amp;rdquo; if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like the job; he gets to shoot things again (or turn them into craters); and the pay is great. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his thirty-sixth birthday, Rex goes to a bar looking for nothing more than brandy and a chance to mourn another loss in peace. Instead, he meets a fascinating redhead who also works for the DoD. Rex wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning to get involved with anyone, but sometimes you just &lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt; with someone, and he fits with Euan Ambrus very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rex&amp;rsquo;s new favorite redhead is also the reason why 2016 decides to push the envelope on what&amp;rsquo;s normal, even for him. If he&amp;rsquo;s going to make an enemy out of an organization within the federal government, it might as well be one that&amp;rsquo;s been up to sci-fi levels of weird since 1951&amp;hellip;the same organization that&amp;rsquo;s ultimately responsible for Rex&amp;rsquo;s eerily precise instincts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
