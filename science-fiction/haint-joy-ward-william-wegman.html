  <title>Haint - Joy Ward, William Wegman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
How did we evolve?  Did we have help? In a world torn apart by cataclysmic climate changes, survivors learn answers to these immortal questions as they join together based on their love of various dog breeds. Two voices, the weimaraner Haint and his mistress Amanda, tell the story of how each in their own way come to the realization of what they mean to each other. Along the way, Haint explains how his species came to help humans along in their evolutionary development. Haint also reveals that the world is becoming inhabitable for humans and dogs so he and his kind must make the decision whether to save themselves and what they have learned over the thousands of years on Earth or stay and take their chances with the doomed humans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Amanda, accompanied by her friends Kern and Liddy and their canine familiars Haint and Cloudy, travel across a landscape with violent weather and competing tribes as they look for a way to save their &quot;breed&quot; from drought.  During the trip they take on an enigmatic young girl who is much more than she appears. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Haint is the story of lives entangled over thousands of years and hundreds of lifetimes as dogs and humans discover the depths of their love for each other.
