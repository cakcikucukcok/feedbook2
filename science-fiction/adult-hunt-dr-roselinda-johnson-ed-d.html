This book will help other children to know that they are not alone in their suffering and where to go for help. All of this is entwined into a science fiction story where the children get to travel into a domed underwater environment near Washington, D.C. where they receive everything a child could want.  They then get to choose which Holodeck Maze Game their abusers must go through in order to pay them back for their many abuses. No person is actually killed or injured during this competition, however, the abusers feel the effects of the games in real time. Both the child and the abuser are given gold rings with angels whose eyes turn from green to ruby red when it is their time to complete the games. &quot;May your chances favor your outcomes&quot; was written across the top of each application which the children had filled out and e-mailed to enter the Holodeck Maze  Games." />
