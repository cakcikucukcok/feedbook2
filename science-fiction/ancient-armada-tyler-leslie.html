  <title>Ancient Armada - Tyler Leslie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year is 2047. A sudden insurgence of alien creatures has burst forth from the interior of Earth, taking up the mantel of the righteous crusade and vying for the blood of every man, woman and child on the planet. There seems to be no hope, as the alien race is merciless and efficient, and its ultimate goal is beyond human comprehension.
Enter Davis Martin, United States Marine Corps Cadet and one of the first people to have encountered this new enemy in the field. Can he complete his training and graduate into the ranks of the military before the entire world is engulfed in uncontrollable flame? And if so, will he have what it takes to make a difference?
An English prince with a penchant for narcissism and chauvinistic passion, has a dark secret. Despite being the most successful capitalist in history, he hungers for more power - seeking it from the depths of this new race&#39;s psyche. Can he control the enemy long enough to get what he wants, or will he be destroyed with the rest of humanity?
Finally, Arr&#39;itaoll, the Warlord of the Scuratt&#39;ka, a being that is effectively Commander and Chief, General, Judge and Executioner all in one, has a morality problem. He has lived his entire life being told there is but one glorious purpose to his existence: destroying humanity in its entirety. However, is this &#39;glorious crusade&#39; truly in the cards for him? Or will he turn his back on his own race and help the ones he has sworn to destroy? Only time will tell..." />
