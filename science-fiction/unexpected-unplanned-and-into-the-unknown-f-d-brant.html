  <title>Unexpected Unplanned and into the Unknown - F. D. Brant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a post-apocalyptic world where the event is no more than myth, Jay, a young male is about to enter into the world of adults. Still he feels he must accomplish a lifelong dream before making that transition. Since the time of childhood he stared at the dizzying heights of those mountain peaks behind their village and he wanted to conquer them. Once he becomes an adult, then such thoughts must go away. The world of adults is about what is important, what is necessary to survive, what needs to be done to protect their village, and to help wherever and whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, with less time available he begins his quest not knowing that it will change his life forever. And once he goes through those gates nothing, absolutely nothing will be the same. His known world will end, and before he realizes it death will be a close companion. And with this, time will reveal to him more than he ever imagined or knew existed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
