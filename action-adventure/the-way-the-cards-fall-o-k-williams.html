He decides to go west to seek his fortune. While passing through Fort Smith, Arkansas, his talent with firearms brings him into contact with Al, a friend of his army Sergeant. Al puts Jason into training to be a gunsmith and together they build a successful business around a pistol that Al has modified from &quot;cap and ball&quot; to a cartridge fed weapon.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;Jason&#39;s capacity to &lt;U&gt;be&lt;/U&gt; a friend, gains him the love and help of many, in his quest to build his life, including some of the prominent men of the day such as Confederate General P.T.G. Beauregard and others.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;While in Fort Smith Jason meets a young girl with a past. He becomes very fond of her but he cannot forget the beautiful Creole woman. He has the misfortune to love two women.
