  <title>The Whispering Cove Kids Club - Donna Crouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the continuing fictional story of a group of friends who live in a fictional town on the coast of South Carolina. The children have grown a little older in this book and will continue to grow up in other stories. They are Christian children and attend the same schools and some of the same churches.
This adventure is based in part on some facts from the past of the author. I spent some time working with children and adults who lived through some painful and abusive times. A few were from my own childhood. 
The friend who will tell this story is Katrina, who, along with her friend Jake and a new friend Tim, went on a bike trip to a nearby beach. While on this trip, they discover something strange is going on at the old abandoned lighthouse, which is just a short distance out of town.
She calls all her friends in the club and, along with them and a lot of imagination, have a hair-raising adventure that includes a murder in the night, a ghost story, eerie sounds, running and screaming, bad people, and breaking and entering. This brings out a science teacher, a lawyer, a judge, and the police.
This book is written as a book within a book." />
