  <title>ALEAVE VS. THE BLACK DEMON - Michelle Eddington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When we last left Aleave, she had chosen to stay with William, in the city of Sundun. Her feelings for William seem to be blossoming more with each passing day, and she has found a new career, working with William&amp;rsquo;s longtime best friend, Dylan, to help the people of Sundun.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even though she made the difficult choice to leave her family and her old world and old life behind, Aleave is happier than she has ever been. As she grows accustomed to life in Sundun, however, a new, vile enemy rises from the dark to complicate her life. The strain of this new adversary&amp;rsquo;s attack on the city of Sundun weakens Aleave&amp;rsquo;s relationship with William, and as the darkness slowly begins to consume and destroy the city, Aleave finds herself emotionally compromised by the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the place from whence Aleave came, Mica, Resizden, Calen, and Seth are forced to move on without her in their lives. Resizden takes her absence the hardest, as he was very hurt that Aleave chose to stay with William in Sundun. Mica was still in charge of the Dweller land and army. Seth became a professional Dweller hunter. Calen finished his healing training and chose to become a doctor. Resizden, heartbroken, slowly became distant with this family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
