  <title>Adventures of Wyatt West - W. Todd Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wyatt West is a fictional Character in realistic situations. Most of the stories are from memories of my family and friends. Ranch and farm life is a totally different life from that of a kid that lives in a city.  So with the Wyatt West series, people can learn what ranch life is like. Many people cannot believe that there is anything to do in the country.  They think life would be boring without the city lights, malls, game rooms, parks and many other activities to try to keep youth busy in a city.  In the country kids with free time make their own fun. There are horses to ride, and miles of land to explore. Fun can be found with imagination and curiosity.  Safety is usually not a big concern because the kids learn from an early age the dangers of certain critters and equipment that can be around a ranch or farm.  Country kids learn to be respectful of adults and more self dependent from an early age.  It really is not much effort for a young person on a ranch to be responsible for the care and management of a horse.  Most kids in the country are expected to help with their part of chores, and work around a ranch or farm.  It takes a family to manage a ranch or farm in todays economy." />
