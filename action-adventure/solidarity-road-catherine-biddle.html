  <title>Solidarity Road - Catherine Biddle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Devon Albright seemingly has it all. A successful businessman, hes leveraged every advantage his gracious life has ever offered to him. The years have also been kind to him, and his tall, athletic physique served him well in both his professional and his personal life. He is charming, influential, and above all, a good friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For half a century, his friendship with Andrew Sanders has been a constant source of happiness, support, and comfort. Andrew has not weathered the decades with as much grace or success, but his friendship never wavers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child living in Africa with his family, Devon made his first true friend in a local boy named Gabbie. The son of the Albrights gardener, the two quickly became inseparable. It broke Devons heart to leave his friend behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, fifty years later, Andrew tells Devon that Gabbie is in trouble and needs their help. The two embark on a long and dangerous journey to save an old friend at any cost. The risk is extreme, Devon realizes, but that is sometimes the cost of friendship. &lt;/p&gt;" />
