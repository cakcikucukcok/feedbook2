  <title>Son of a Soldier - Aiken A. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Son of a Soldier&lt;/i&gt; is the powerful story of how God used one unlikely, country girl to change the course of history. It seemed impossible to believe that an eighteen-year-old girl from the middle-of-nowhere, Tennessee would have any real significance in the history of our nationthat is until God chose her to make a Godly man out of a flawed, military heros stubborn son. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hailey was a small town, farm girl who had never left her home state of Tennessee. She was a nave tomboy who possessed an unassuming charm, the power of which she could not comprehend.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grant was a rebellious Army brat who had seen the world. Glib, sarcastic and self-destructive, he was a loner lost in a world he had never felt he fit into.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;They seemingly had little in common, but when two hearts collided, two worlds became one; while Hailey embarks on a beautiful journey of self-discovery in this unique coming-of-age story, Grant travels a winding, dirt road that helps him rediscover a lost innocence and discover a renewed purpose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
