  <title>The Evolution of Nora - William Post</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book takes a twelve year old girl through her life to age twenty-nine.  Her name is Nora Wilson.  Her next door neighbor becomes her best friend and business partner.  His name is Wally Daily.  Even though Wally is twelve years older than Nora they make a good team as Wally sees her intelligence and they have similar interests  They write two books together before Wally is framed by two boys and is sent to prison.  Wally does well in prison and is pardoned after four years when the two boys confess to framing him.  During his time in prison Nora inherits a paralegal business which she turns into a large law firm.  Through her ingenuity she builds a thirty-seven story business building where her law firm occupies the first floor and she occupies the penthouse of the high rise as her living quarters.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;After law school she is invited to join the F. B. I. for a special mission, to take down a New York crime family.  Nora must undergo plastic surgery to change her looks and study for a year to become an Italian woman, Angela Gambini, who is her age and is the daughter of a Sicilian Crime boss.  The Sicilian Crime boss is the brother of the head of a New York crime family, Carlos Gambini, who Nora is to bring down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story has many exciting scenes with Nora at the center of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
