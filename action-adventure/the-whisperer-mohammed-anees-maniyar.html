  <title>The Whisperer - Mohammed Anees Maniyar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Whisperer is the story of the struggle between Mankind and the Jinns, since the time the Almighty created the universe. Each tried their best to prove their supremacy over the other and wars were fought over this. The faction of the Jinns, who were excommunicated from their tribes for being insolents and outlaws, connived to abet the Messiah of Darkness, the Eblis, in bringing the moral values of the Jinns and Mankind to destruction, since they knew that, the one who is virtuous can never be defeated by the darker shades of vileness. 
Omar, belonged to the genealogy of the great Persian Sufi Poet, jurist, Islamic scholar and theologian of thirteenth century; Moulana Rumi. Moulana Rumi was enlightened with an art of making Akseer Al-Hayaat, an Elixir of Life, by the Almighty God. The art was kept preserved and untouched by the coming generations of Rumi from the invasion of mankind and the Jinns. When the chieftain of the tribes of Insolent Jinns offered one of the forefathers of Omar a golden fortune for sharing those priceless secrets, he preferred leaving his homeland and travelled to a place called Bijapur, across the Indian Ocean. 
When the Chieftain of the Insolent Jinns chooses Aarob, a Jinn, to find out the secret recipe of the elixir, Omar gets caught in the middle. The girl he loves is possessed by Aarob who makes a deal with Omar to free his love in return for the secret recipe. But, will Omar betray the generations of his family and bestow the gift of immortality to those who are undeserving? 
The Whisperer will take you through the events that proclaim the victory of love, ethics and moral values and defeat of hatred, bestiality and wickedness; the saga of a sublime journey." />
