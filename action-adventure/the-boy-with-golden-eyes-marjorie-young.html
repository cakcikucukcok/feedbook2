  <title>The Boy with Golden Eyes - Marjorie Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young Rupert, with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and experience, has been raised in complete isolation from the world by his enigmatic grandparents. His life takes an extraordinary turn when a violent storm uncovers a long-concealed treasure.  In the aftermath of the storm, his grandparents vanish. Completely alone, the bewildered boy seizes upon the opportunity to leave his forest home at last.
Out in the wider world, Rupert encounters new friends and learns that the kingdom&#39;s beloved royal family has been slain by brutal usurpers, who now rule the land with cunning and cruelty. But astonishing revelations convince Rupert that he has a pivotal role in restoring justice to the land.
As Rupert and his comrades face imprisonment, bloody skirmishes, desperate conditions, and alluring yet sinister encounters, the darkest moments may reveal astonishing wonders. Unfolding events take on a deeper meaning as Rupert&#39;s mysterious gifts guide him toward shattering revelations and truths about his identity and his destiny." />
