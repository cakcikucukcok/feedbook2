  <title>The Lost Treasure of Nostradamus - Mark Lee Masters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Lost Treasure of Nostradamus is a fiction adventure story about looking for sunken treasure in the Caribbean.  Bill Phillips, Mary Thresher and her father Jim use sances in order to talk to Nostradamus and learn more about how to find his treasure.  The treasure actually belonged to King Henry II, the King of France.  The king sent his treasure towards Jamaica for safe keeping, but a vicious storm sank his treasure ship.  
Nostradamus was a seer and was able to record secretly where the ship was located.  For the purpose of making the book more interesting, I have positioned Nostradamus in hell with his friend, Satan.  I actually dont know where Nostradamus went after he died.  Nostradamus did much good as a physician in his day, but he doubted his own salvation.  Be sure to read the preface to the book.  It is quite interesting and contains more about Nostradamus." />
