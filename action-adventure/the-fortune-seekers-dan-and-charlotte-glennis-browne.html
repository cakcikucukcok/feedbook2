e Fortune Seekers - Dan and Charlotte in this revised edition, by answering
questions the 21st century reader may never imagine asking.

he got there.
 To be free, all you need to do is step o the ledge towards me.

backwards.
e struggles are real, resulting in life changing decisions. Dan and Charlottes
compelling story portrays anger, disappointment, hope, forgiveness, love, loss, grief
and decisiveness.
 Will their problems be solved if they join the thousands of emigrants as early pioneers in
Australia?

and religious issues facing the population of Great Britain in the mid 1800s.
e second book of the moving series will be published soon
Reviews
John Nuyten - Australia
 Browne enlightens us of the struggle to break out in a time of conformity. Questioning when
questions were scarcely asked. Great Story.
Tim Gurung (Author) HongKong
 is book is not only a historical novel but also a history by itself and everyone who has
roots from the British side must read it. I couldnt help but feel like I was watching those old
Western movies when people were moving around and living a life of gypsies.

 Loved your story, Glennis! Love the characters and the historical background - loving to
hate Charlottes cousin! It is a well researched story. Now We are looking forward to your
next book
Hilary and Brian Fallis - Australia
 Just a quick email Glennis to tell you we enjoyed e Fortune Seekers immensely, you clever
girl you! I read it aloud to Brian everyday, chapter by chapter, and we both loved every
minute. Amazing the struggles and hardships these courageous people worked through. I
highly recommend this well written novel. Cant wait to read the next of the series.
