  <title>Once Upon a Nightmare - William F. Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Hunter Kerrigan, a superbly skilled and highly decorated Force Recon Marine Officer, and son of a former CIA Station Chief is aggressively recruited from the Corps to pursue a career in The Agency. After training at The Farm in Virginia, his first assignment is to find and terminate a former CIA agent and defector turned international assassin, code name Pisces. While tracking Pisces, Hunter faces ambushes by covert agents from three foreign governments. These attacks are peculiarly set up by his own agent runner, sensuous Samantha McGee and her two high echelon CIA bosses. While enmeshed in the hunt for Pisces, three of Kerrigan&#39;s former lady friends are hideously murdered with no apparent connection other than he had dated them in the past. The police in three US cities believe it&#39;s a serial killer, however, Hunter is convinced it&#39;s a means of revenge, and is Pisces&#39; at his most evil.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hunter continues his tenacious search and termination mission, and while doing so becomes involved with a steamy Israeli Mossad operative, Dvorah. Closing on his target, Hunter then discovers that Pisces is also the murderer of his father years before in London.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Further, Dvorah is assassinated for assisting him. After tracking Pisces through San Francisco, London, Pisa and the Amalfi coast, he finds the recurrently vanishing Pisces on the Isle of Capri under another alias and living with the widow of a man he murdered early on.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Here the mission comes to an end...or does it? And Pisces is terminated...or is he?&lt;/P&gt;
