&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-indent:.5in&#39;&gt;To Snare a Fox is a rip roaring
adventure novel about international drug trafficking on a grand scale involving
oil supply boats, cargo ships and oil rigs. Follow the scented trail of the Fox
around the world as DEA agent Jim Douglas tries to track down this illusive,
clever, ruthless international criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-indent:.5in&#39;&gt;In 1989, the Americans invaded
Panama and arrested President Noriega for drug trafficking into the USA. During
the battle that followed, two DEA (Drug Executive Administration), agents, working
out of the American Embassy arrested a general who was about to deliver a truck
load of narcotics to a British national, called the Fox, whose boat was tied up
in the harbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-tab-count:1&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The two
agents: Jim Douglas and Sam Pollard disguised themselves, masquerading as
Panamanian army officers and drove the truck to the harbour in the old town
area, for a fateful meeting with the Fox. Their plan was to arrest the Fox
while he exchanged a suitcase of money for the drugs, but they had not taken
into consideration the ruthless, devious intentions of the Fox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-tab-count:1&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;When some
time later, a group of follow up CIA agents found the two men, they had been
shot. Pollard was dead. Douglas had been shot in the back twice. He was alive
but barely breathing. The Fox escaped with the drugs and found sanctuary in
Columbia, until the invasion blew over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-indent:.5in&#39;&gt;Months later, agent Jim Douglas
made a full recovery. It had been a startling, incredible recover from serious
body wounds but, although his body had been healed, his mind was still wounded,
by the trauma of seeing his fellow agent and friend die. Douglas had suffered
from the Foxs gun, and would never forget the cold, steel, blue eyes and the
cruel, merciless face of the man who had shot him. Nor would he forget the
promise that he had made to Pollard, as he lay dying, lying beside him on the
