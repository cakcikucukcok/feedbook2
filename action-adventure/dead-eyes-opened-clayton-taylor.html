  <title>Dead Eyes Opened - Clayton Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book tells the story of two different men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One story involves Rick Stanton, an air traffic controller who also works part time as a flight instructor and charter pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ricks best friend is killed in an airline training accident, he is outraged when the NTSB rules the crash a result of, pilot error. He sets out to prove the NTSB wrong and encounters opposition at every turn. Not only is he driven to find the truth, but he must also battle the demons from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second story is told first person, is a story about a man who works in the Department of Defense as a, not your typical spy. He frequently finds himself in over his head dodging death and bullets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two men share a past. Although they each lead separate lives, they are both searching for the same things: happiness and meaning. Events outside their control will bringthe two together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a strange twist of fate, while they each pursue a vendetta, they find they have quite a bit in common. Not the least of which is; they are both looking for the same person.&lt;/p&gt;" />
