  <title>The Safano Dementia - Selina Elliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where were her shoes? It was strange to even think about it. There were certainly more frightening things to consider. The guns, the men, the crash; plus there were all the things left behind which included her passport. These were all too much. So she thought, instead, about her bare feet.
Rebecca Dawson had worked hard to afford this trip to France. She wanted to see everything, and experience all Europe had to offer. And she longed for adventure. Canada was home but it was safe. What was life without a little adventure? What she hadnt wanted was what she and her two best friends had found. Now they faced imprisonment, torture, and slavery. But the most frightening was the one thing they didnt know about; the reason Fredrick Brouillette and his group were here.
And in the midst of it all, Rebecca would have the answer to the one question she had never seriously asked herself, how would she handle a crisis?" />
