  <title>Deep Green - Stone Spicer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Deep Greens appeal derives from the extensive use of the authors real-life experiences in time, place, and knowledge of Hawaii. Stones innate curiosity for experiencing life beneath the surface injected his writing with a sense of authority and authenticity. 
You wont be exposed to violence, torrid sex, or offensive profanity but will, instead, have a brief glimpse into the lives of what the islands first discoverers might have seen and experienced and then accompany Kensington Stone as he rescues a drowning young geology student. Youll journey across the islands of Oahu and the big island of Hawaii as Stone struggles to extricate his new friend, Viane Koa, from repeated attempts on her life and eventual kidnapping. Journeying through Deep Green, you will experience the terrifying void of light deep in the bowels of a lava tube and be left to drown with Viane as she desperately clings to life miles from shore, fighting against the merciless energy of the ocean. 
Deep Greens adventure, humor, and romance will lure you on through page after page. Ancient antiquities are at play as black marketers attempt to steal a part of Hawaiis heritage in the wake of an indifference that proves to be Stone and Vianes true nemeses." />
