Mike lives with Doc and his family for three years until tragedy strikes, jolting Mike back to reality. Mike leaves in search of his true love. He takes a train ride on the Indian Pacific across the rugged outback to Sydney. There, he reunites with his best friend Burton Phillips and ruthless polo patron Jack Keating.
