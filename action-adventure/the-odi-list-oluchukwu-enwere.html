  <title>The Odi List - Oluchukwu Enwere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The hunt for the most dangerous assassin south of the Sahara is underway; unprecedented in the centuries old history of the region, an assassin who uses unconventional methods and has threatened and shaken the very foundations of public order and authority. An assassin that will not stop until the end.A 
In the center of it all is a young intrepid agent, who is determined to track down this killer. His mission leads him to uncover a horrible crime committed fourteen years ago in a remote village in the Niger-Delta, and the mysteries surrounding the personality of the UNSUB, and most importantly, the motive. He soon realizes that he is engaged in a battle for not just his career, but his own life hangs in the balance. 
As an act of desperation, the authorities appoint their most ruthless cop; Sergeant Ibrahim, a notorious no-nonsense police officer, devoid of empathy. 
Newly promoted, he must prove himself worthy of his new position and rank or die trying. With a combination of ruthlessness and cunning, he soon tracks down the assassin to another remote village, where the stage is being set for the assassination of the ultimate target; the president." />
