&lt;p&gt; This Book has been the #1 favorite of my 3rd and 5th Grade Students for many years!! From this story, my students discover that pure love and friendship are the best gifts of all!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Teacher, Joyce Carr
&lt;p&gt; What a fantastic story! Its a heartwarming story about the enduring power of friendship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Former Student, Beth Ballart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This book is one of the most powerful stories of lifelong love and friendship 20 years later, this is the only story I can remember being truly inspired by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Former Student, Doug Lee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Your book is great!  My whole class gave it an A+  Im going to buy two copies (if my mom lets me). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 3rd Grade Student, E. Cummins &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This is the best book I have heard I could read it over and over, until I memorized it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- 3rd Grade Student, M. OToole&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Out of all the books our teacher has read to us this year, this was the best. It was very exciting. &lt;/p&gt;
