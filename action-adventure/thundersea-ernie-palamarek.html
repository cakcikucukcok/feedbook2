      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;F&lt;/B&gt;ollow the intrigue as this sizzling beach book takes
      you on a red-hot adventure from Victoria on Vancouver Island
      to Kailua-Kona on the tropical Big Island of Hawaii. Witness
      the encounters, the likes of which you have never seen, with
      the goddess Pele who lives in the Kilauea volcano. &lt;BR&gt;
      &lt;B&gt;T&lt;/B&gt;he pristine coral sea of the Hawaiian Island&#39;s Humpback
      Whale National Marine Sanctuary is rocked by a mysterious explosive
      eruption at Keahole Point on Hawaii&#39;s exotic Kona coast. The
      ecology of the sea and the ordinary lives of the inhabitants
      of the small town of Kailua Kona are tossed into turmoil. A series
      of accidents occur, leading to suggestions of murder.
      &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;K&lt;/B&gt;iana Kilolani, a beautiful but demure Hawaiian schoolteacher,
      is plagued with daunting daytime apparitions and haunting nightmares.
      She fears she is slowly going mad as these spectres persist.
      Her alter ego entices men with soul-searing kisses. Or is it
      her alter-ego? Her impeccable reputation in the town is in danger
      of being eroded. She is in the prime of her life and yet, is
      afraid for her life.
      &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;C&lt;/B&gt;hung Min-Ho, a greedy ex-North Korean marine commando
      who got his start as a ruthless entrepreneur by defecting with
      a Shark-class submarine, looms menacingly. He and his company,
      Global Sea Marine, keep turning up like bad pennies.
      &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;M&lt;/B&gt;anny Manetti, a comical, small-time marina operator,
      has big-time ambitions - he has wheeled and dealed his way into
      a SeaTruck submersible dealership.
      &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;K&lt;/B&gt;imo Kekuna, Hawaiian Chief and a former Navy SEAL
      who served in Central America and Desert Storm operations, gets
      involved to help his former buddy with this baffling mystery.
      &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;D&lt;/B&gt;r. Sarah Leikaina, volcanologist, rock climber and
      a SeaTruck submersible pilot exploring the deep vents off Vancouver
      Island and Hawaii, erotically tantalizes men with her voluptuous
      body and passionate kisses.
      &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rune Erikson&lt;/B&gt;, of Norwegian descent and formerly in
      the service of a shadowy government communications agency, is
      lured off his sailing ship, the ketch &lt;I&gt;Valhalla,&lt;/I&gt; in Victoria&#39;s
      Fisherman&#39;s Wharf by the subterfuge of a former colleague. Rune
      is sucked&lt;I&gt; &lt;/I&gt;into the vortex of this intrigue that is scented
      with the myths and legends of Hawaiian culture, quickly falling
      into the erotic embrace of the strikingly-beautiful Hawaiian
      volcanologist." />
