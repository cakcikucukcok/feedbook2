  <title>A Good Reason to Lie - Martha Ashleigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robby is running for his life!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a material witness in the Federal Crimes Division, fourteen-year-old Robby Hartman is an easy target for the violent men who would do anything to keep him from testifying. For his own safety, Robby goes into hiding under an assumed name. A foster home is found for him on a remote island off the coast of Southern California. The moment Robby steps onto the deck of the Santa Teresa Island Ferry, he feels his past life slip away. Here he is, traveling by himself to a place where he has never been, to live with people he has never met, and to be known by a name he never heard until yesterday. Robby, now Rory Mendez, becomes part of the Dominguez family. Cherishing Rory as one of their own, the family demonstrates the meaning of unconditional love. Rory and thirteen-year-old Mateo, the youngest Dominguez child, become fast friends. Rory feels increasingly remorseful about lying to these gracious and generous people. Ironically, it is an entanglement of small lies that finally reveals Rory&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts to the criminals who are tracking him, placing Rory&amp;rsquo;s new family and friends in harm&amp;rsquo;s way. A Good Reason to Lie is a rich tale filled with humor, adventure, and emotion. Set in 1955, the book is a poignant reminder of simpler times, yet it reveals how some things like friendship, first love, and a sense of belonging are timeless and universal to the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
