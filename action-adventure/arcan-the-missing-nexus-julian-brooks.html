  <title>Arcan: The Missing Nexus - Julian Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Evil&amp;#39;s shadowy form has manifested once again after centuries of hiatus to harvest the ashes of a grayed and brittle planet in its final days. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Exxarians&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;have returned and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Terra&lt;/em&gt;, a husk of the vivid world it once was, hasn&amp;#39;t the power to thwart their inferno of smoke. But evil&amp;#39;s plot has only begun. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Godfall&lt;/em&gt;, a totem of the most ancient and powerful Exxarian has been uncovered. With it, evil has the means to set out on its conquest against the Creator once and for all, but only once destruction has been wrought upon all Created.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a battered and bruised soldier who has known hatred and strife as much as survival, Kyran sees the end of days as a chance at liberation long overdue. However, it is neither in his nature nor his blood to abandon the world. He soon learns what he is&amp;mdash;not just an&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Arcan&lt;/em&gt;, the first Created race to walk upon Terra&amp;mdash;but a key to the world&amp;#39;s most ancient and dormant power. After centuries of genocide, however, there are no more Arcans left to show him the world&amp;#39;s deepest secrets. Kyran is at the mercy of an insidious royal bloodline with curious intentions. On an unlikely expedition with his queen and her company, Kyran experiences an awakening that changes the course of everything. The Exxarians are more real than any gospel could ever foretell. And now he and the entity of ultimate destruction are intertwined. Yet he does what he does best:&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;survive&lt;/em&gt;. Now the Exxarians are on a voracious hunt, trampling boundaries like never before to reclaim him. But an enlightened Arcan is a dangerous thing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
