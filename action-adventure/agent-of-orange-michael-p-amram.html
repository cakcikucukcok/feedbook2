  <title>Agent of Orange - Michael P Amram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Corporal Chauncy T. McClarren is a Vietnam Veteran.  His ten years of service as a marine are glibly worn on the sleeve of his dress uniform well into civilian life.  He went to Vietnam before the draft began with the hope of being a martyr.  He is reluctant to admit this to his friend and even to himself.
Elizabeth A Spaarkes randomly selects Chauncys door. She fleas to Florida after two years in the Symbionese Liberation Army. She is the perfect woman.  She is a redheaded goddess.  Lizzy is a nymphomaniac who fills his every desire sexually, and eventually, domestically.  
Gunnery Sergeant Harrold H. Coffman comes home from the war a paraplegic.   He owes his life to his Corporal.  One day he learns on the news of Spaarkess possible involvement with the left-wing group.  He believes she is guilty.  Chauncy chooses to give her the benefit of the doubt.  He refuses to believe a woman that beautiful could be a fugitive.
Agent of Orange is the story of a Rheinlandbastard.   Chauncy is a pragmatist who shifts the stations in life around so the logistics favor him.  It follows his trail of passively sequencing fate from Vietnam to Florida.  It leads him to the Bahamas where he takes an orphaned boy back to Florida.  Fate leads him on a series of trips to Germany to learn his origin.
It is the story of a biracial miscreant who grew up unloved and beaten.  It is one mans perception of racism in America and abroad.   He is taught some manners and discipline in the marines.  He faces a world that begs for his attention as he begs for its salvation.  The marines outfit him with the diplomacy necessary to deal with what life has thrown, and continues to throw, at him.  Chauncy T. McClarren takes his time in life.   He orchestrates things while sauntering through life with a grifting nonchalance.  He is methodical and pragmatic enough to see his various operations through to the end." />
