  <title>Emerald - Garry Richardson, Bill Barnier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sam, a 95-year-old man of decades on the sea, receives one final summons from his first and decades-long true love, Macy. As he casts off on one last voyage across the Atlantic from South America back home to Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, he remenisces on the many times over the decades he and Macy spent time together: meeting and immediately falling in love, having a son; always loving each other but never staying together. Every time she called for him he returned to her, each time hoping it would be the time they finally stay with each other...but it was never meant to be. His 5500-mile sea trip allows him time to relive their lives, always apart but occasionally together, and the dreams that could have been. He arrives home in time for one last sea venture with his true First Mate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
