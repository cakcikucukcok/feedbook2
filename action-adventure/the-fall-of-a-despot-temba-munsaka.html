  <title>The Fall of a Despot - Temba Munsaka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dan is an enigma and a survivor. Dan is the best, a killer by instinct both with and without guns. He was trained by the best in the field, the masters of terrorism. His peers loathe him, and his enemies run for dear life when his name is mentioned. He leads a group of soldiers who were wronged by the abusive dictator unto a revenge mission. The crimes against them are unforgiveable. They employ the same tactics they used against the enemies of the state to deal with the regime, a taste of their own medicine. They elude the security apparatus against them and strike right at the heart of the infamous dictators security cordon. Its a field day for the international press as the dictator is handed over to the International Criminal Court for prosecution, for crimes against humanity. The generals take over a country torn by mismanagement, and they get entrenched, the country moves to a civil war." />
