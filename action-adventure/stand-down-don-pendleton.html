      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When a prominent family is murdered and their teenage daughter is nowhere to be found, Mack Bolan knows something is shady in Quincyville, Kansas. His plan had been to pass through while seeking a little downtime. But now he&#39;s not leaving until he finds out what evil has the town in its grip.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After a soft probe, Bolan discovers that an industrial meth lab is functioning under the guise of a pharmaceutical company. A Mexican drug lord has taken control of the Midwest town and the local police are on the organization&#39;s payroll. The residents are too terrified to speak up. With the life of a young woman at stake, the time for defense is over. The Executioner decides to shut down the lab…and clean up the town for good.&lt;/p&gt;
