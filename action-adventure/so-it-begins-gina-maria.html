  <title>So It Begins - Gina Maria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A holocaust is coming to Earth in the form of a deadly virusone that will bring pandemonium and disaster to all. To survive, a wealthy billionaire named Simion builds a gigantic complex in the side of a mountain. He becomes a modern-day Noah, bringing in two of each living creature and providing protection for all those working on the top-secret project. 
When the day of reckoning arrives, one of Simions key people, Zack, is home attending to his fathers funeral. Too far away to make it to the complex, Zack has no choice but to stay put and watch the destruction around him. Incredibly, Zack discovers he is immune to the virus. He finds six other survivors, and the small group is determined to stay alive, no matter the obstacles they face. 
The group begins the long, arduous journey to find the compound, but as the years pass and Zack grows more and more confused as to its exact location, hope begins to run out. Yet before his death, Zack passes on the information to his children; now it is up to them to find Simions complex. Only then will the future of the world be secure. 
Unique in scope, &lt;i&gt;So It Begins&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting tale of how one individuals foresight and intellect becomes mankinds last hope." />
