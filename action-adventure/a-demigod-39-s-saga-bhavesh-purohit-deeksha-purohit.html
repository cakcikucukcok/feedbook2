  <title>A Demigod&#39;s Saga - Bhavesh Purohit, Deeksha Purohit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story cannot be confined to a mere fictional category. It crosses boundaries and mingles with most of the categories, including fantasy, suspense, love story/romance, philosophical, humor, intense family drama, etc. Though a fiction, it covers the fantasy because of its superhero element; it is a suspense because of the never-ending twists and turns in the story; its a love story between the protagonist and his lady love; and its philosophical because whenever the superhero falls in the story, he is forced to redeem his thinking and get himself motivated by listening to his elders wise thoughts. There is a sting of dry humor in the dialogues and intense family drama because it involves relationship and their importance that we share in our everyday life. The story revolves around a central theme of the real essence of life, being Life is not about how many times we fail, but how many times we rise above from our failures, as the protagonist fails to deliver multiple times in the story but again raises himself above his failures, forcing people to believe in him time and again." />
