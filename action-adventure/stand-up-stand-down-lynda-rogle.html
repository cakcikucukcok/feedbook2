  <title>Stand up Stand Down - Lynda Rogle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story is set in a country struggling to come to terms with change and challenged by the difficulty of good governance in the face of dire poverty juxtaposed with immense wealth. The hero finds himself challenged on a personal and professional level to be faithful to the truth and loyal to his calling even as his family disintegrates because of this. His journey to find the truth takes him to places and people who contribute to both his search and his personal growth in a way that he never expects. What starts out as a simple story about an attempted murder, in a country where murder is the order of the day, becomes an intriguing journey; a journey that exposes the dark underbelly of a society that is bent on proving to itself and the world at large that the democracy won with the blood of innocent children is a reality. The outcome is as unexpected as it is thought provoking." />
