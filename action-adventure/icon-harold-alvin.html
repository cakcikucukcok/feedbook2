that North Korea had started to shut
down its main nuclear plant at Pyongsong. It is hoped they will continue to
dismantle their nuclear weapons.
Sergeant Mac Erick recovered from his gunshot wounds and the infection that
ravaged his body. However, the infection did damage his heart. He spent several
weeks in the hospital before receiving a medical discharge. His best buddy Sergeant

video and camera communications expert with one of the major broadcast affiliates

Sergeant Leyton Wesley completed his tour of duty in South Korea. For a short
time he preformed contractual work for the U.S. Army. He has since moved back
to his home state of Texas  in Richardson  where he operates a successful camera
