  <title>Kathleen of the Outer Banks - Capt. Gardner Martin Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kathleen Olsen called Svenska Flicker by her grandmother is of Swedish stock. The old grandmother wants better than a shack on these beautiful Outer Banks Sea Shores; she wants her to have the whole world, as she did sailing with her husband. 
&lt;p&gt;
Kathleen is guarded well, not allowed to run loose as are many of the young girls of the Outer Banks. She is pure and innocent when a young captain flaunts his skill and daring to bring his schooner, white sails full into the inlet.
&lt;p&gt;
Kathleen sees the captain and his ship, as her prince charming on his white charger. It was love at first sight and the romance blossoms. Married, the lovers sail on and on.
&lt;p&gt;
Then Svenska shows a wild streak in her so demure ways and has to be punished. All is forgiven, the crew was happy. Then tragedy strikes, Kathleen dives from aloft in the rigging and hits the rail. Broken and bloody she is almost feed for the sharks. 
&lt;p&gt;
Bunk ridden, Kathleen tries to kill herself; she wants to set her young husband free to live a life without an invalid wife. 
&lt;p&gt;
Captain Kelley saves a man from being killed by muggers while docked in New York. He was once a famed surgeon turned into a drunk; he is signed on as ship doctor. He tends and studies Kathleen. Months later as a skilled surgeon again he operates on Kathleens ailments.
&lt;p&gt;
The good doctor is so pleased and once more acclaimed. He makes the down payment on a small freighter for the man that saved his life, and the little lady that gave him back his confidence. 
&lt;p&gt;
The good doctor waved good bye as the small freighter weighed anchor. Kathleen was tucked under her Captains arm as the ship turned into the sinking sun.&lt;br&gt;" />
