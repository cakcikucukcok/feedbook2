  <title>Motorcycle High - Dave Harrold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rock Pounder, adventure rider extraordinaire, is planning a round-the-world trip on his motorcycle. His goal is Amsterdam and the herbal refreshment that awaits him there. But when you&amp;rsquo;re a legend&amp;mdash;among women, adventure riders, and spies&amp;mdash;nothing is ever as simple as it seems..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rock has ridden the famous Road of Bones in Russia. He&amp;rsquo;s traveled the snake-infested jungles of Central America, all the way through the Darie?n Gap, where no riders dare to travel. And with his trusty dirt bike, he&amp;rsquo;s climbed the great peaks of the Himalayas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rock Pounder, man of many wiles, has matched wits with the CIA, the KGB, and the Russian mafia. His freewheeling ways hide a world of unexpected secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come along for the ride as Rock and his bike travel onward through Siberia, Mongolia, and Europe. His destination is Amsterdam and the pleasures that lie in store. The journey will take him places he never expected to go. But when Rock Pounder is on a mission, no one stands in his way, except, maybe, a tall blonde who means nothing but trouble.&lt;/p&gt;" />
