  <title>Dragon City - James Axler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Humanity has been held in subjugation for thousands of years, manipulated by a cruel alien race. But what began as a game among self-styled gods evolved into an internecine power play.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Divided by ego and greed, the enemy faced resistance–and a reckoning–from an intrepid group of human rebels. But now the Cerberus operation lies in disarray, its members missing or broken, even as the Annunaki threat is reborn in a new and more horrifying form.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enlil, cruellest of them all, is set to revive the sadistic pantheon that will rule the Earth. Based in his vast Dragon City, Enlil plans to create infinite gods–at the cost of humankind. With the Cerberus team at its lowest ebb, can they possibly stop his twisted plan? Or are they, too, destined to be absorbed by the God Machine?&lt;/p&gt;
