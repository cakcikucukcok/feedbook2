  <title>Wise Phuul - Daniel Stride</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walking corpses and black-market liquor: the quiet life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Telto Phuul, Necromancer and Library Clerk, likes his days safe and predictable. Not for him the intrigues of the Viiminian Empire, a gothic monstrosity held together by sheer force of will.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until the Empire&amp;#39;s dreaded secret police come knocking. Caught in a web of schemes in the diseased heart of Kuolinako, the underground Imperial capital, Telto can trust no-one. Not the Northern theocrats who abhor Necromancy, and certainly not the Grand Chancellor, whose iron-fisted rule has kept the old order alive that little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When one false step means torture and disappearance, this journey will change our Necromancer forever.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;----------&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Family, friendship, and social class lie at the heart of powerful storytelling. Stride delves deep into the hearts and minds of his characters, revealing moral fortitudes that are perfectly balanced with personality flaws and desire for self-preservation. Engaging, subtle and provocative, this is fantasy steampunk that deserves to be read again and again. &lt;em&gt;Wise Phuul&lt;/em&gt; is the story of one man&amp;rsquo;s journey to save himself, his friends, and (by coincidence only), his society.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Stride has created a fantastical world which is wholly believable with a reluctant hero who is nothing if not marvellous. A rollicking adventure and a great read."<br /><b><i>Wise Phuul: Stride, Daniel: 9781908600592: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Daniel Stride created just such a world in his debut novel Wise Phuul. The main character, Telto, is placed in an almost impossible situation and face one trial after another. There were times when I had to take a break from reading this because of the intense drama.<br /><b><i>Wise Phuul by Daniel Stride - Goodreads</i></b> | Daniel Stride is an insightful writer, with some interesting things to say about the fantasy genre. As such, I’ve been eager for the chance to read this debut novel for myself. Far and away the strongest aspect of Wise Phuul, for me, was the world.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Wise Phuul - Daniel Stride</a> </h3></p><hr/>
