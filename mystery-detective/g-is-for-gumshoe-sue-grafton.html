  <title>&quot;G&quot; is for Gumshoe - Sue Grafton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For #1 &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling author Sue Grafton&#39;s PI Kinsey Millhone, danger comes with the job--but she never expects to find herself at the top of a hit man&#39;s list...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;G IS FOR GAME...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Irene Gersh asks PI Kinsey Millhone to locate her elderly mother Agnes, whom she hasn&#39;t heard from in six months, it&#39;s not exactly the kind of case Kinsey jumps for. But a girl&#39;s gotta pay her bills, and this should be easy money--or so she thinks. Kinsey finds Agnes in a hospital. Aside from her occasional memory lapses, the octogenarian seems fine. And frightened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;G IS FOR GUN...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinsey doesn&#39;t know what to make of Agnes&#39;s vague fears and bizarre ramblings, but she&#39;s got her own worries. It seems Tyrone Patty, a criminal she helped put behind bars, is looking to make a hit. First, Kinsey&#39;s car is run off the road, and then days later, she&#39;s almost gunned down, setting in motion a harrowing cat and mouse game... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;G IS FOR &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;GUMSHOE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Kinsey decides to hire a bodyguard. With PI Robert Dietz watching her 24/7, Kinsey is feeling on edge...especially with their growing sexual tension. Then, Agnes dies of an apparent homicide, Kinsey realizes the old lady wasn&#39;t so senile after all--and maybe she was trying to tell her something? Now Kinsey&#39;s determined to learn the truth...even if it kills her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&lt;br&gt;&quot;B&quot; Is for Burglar&lt;br&gt;&quot;C&quot; Is for Corpse&lt;br&gt;&quot;D&quot; Is for Deadbeat&lt;br&gt;&quot;E&quot; Is for Evidence&lt;br&gt;&quot;F&quot;  Is for Fugitive&lt;br&gt;&quot;G&quot; Is for Gumshoe&lt;br&gt;&quot;H&quot; Is for Homicide&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&quot;  Is for Innocent&lt;br&gt;&quot;J&quot;  Is for Judgment&lt;br&gt;&quot;K&quot; Is for Killer&lt;br&gt;&quot;L&quot; is for Lawless&lt;br&gt;&quot;M&quot; Is for Malice&lt;br&gt;&quot;N&quot; Is for Noose&lt;br&gt;&quot;O&quot; Is for Outlaw&lt;br&gt;&quot;P&quot; Is for Peril &lt;br&gt;&quot;Q&quot; Is for Quarry&lt;br&gt;&quot;R&quot; Is for Ricochet &lt;br&gt;&quot;S&quot; Is for Silence &lt;br&gt;&quot;T&quot; Is for Trespass&lt;br&gt;&quot;U&quot; Is for Undertow &lt;br&gt;&quot;V&quot; Is for Vengeance &lt;br&gt;&quot;W&quot; Is for Wasted &lt;br&gt;&quot;X&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
