  <title>Crosshairs - Harry Hunsicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Crosshairs &lt;/i&gt;delivers the goods:  Layered, intense, and rich with deadly characters.  Hunsicker is an emerging star.&quot; --Robert Crais, &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hard-nosed Dallas detective Lee &lt;i&gt;Henry&lt;/i&gt; Oswald is back...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;and he&#39;s better than ever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All he wants is to be left alone, a normal existence away from the assorted creeps and lowlifes inherent to his former profession as a private investigator.  Unfortunately, peace and solitude are hard to find for Lee Oswald, a battle-hardened veteran of the first Gulf War, now weary after a decade as the fix-it man of last resort on the back streets of Dallas. &lt;br&gt;But when internationally-renowned medical researcher Anita Nazari begs him to help find the person threatening her daughter&#39;s life, Oswald reluctantly returns to the shadowy world he&#39;s tried so hard to leave behind.  Once there, he finds himself engaged in a high stakes battle against a man known only as the Professor, a former intelligence operative intent on destroying the results of the doctor&#39;s latest research, a seemingly innocuous discovery about the mystery illness dubbed the Gulf War Syndrome. &lt;br&gt;The retired agent leads Oswald on a deadly search for the one man who can identify him and thus unravel a conspiracy of shady former government officials with an unhealthy interest in Dr. Nazari and her work. When Oswald locates the missing witness and learns the startling information the man possesses, Oswald places his allegiance with the truth, as he fights back against an enemy more insidious and deadly than he&#39;s ever faced.&lt;br&gt;            Gritty, tough, and smart, Hunsicker&#39;s tightly-wrapped thriller will leave you breathless long after the final page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
