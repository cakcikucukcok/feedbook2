She&#39;s sleeping with men on both sides of the Atlantic who are in bed with the women who are trying to sink her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Tess jump ship without losing her clients and breaking her heart?  Or will she lose everything before finding out if she really has what it takes to do what she&#39;s always wanted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s risk and reward in this wickedly funny novel that turns the world of agenting inside out and lays bare all the ambition, sex, adrenaline, bad luck, and good luck at the center of one young woman&#39;s success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
