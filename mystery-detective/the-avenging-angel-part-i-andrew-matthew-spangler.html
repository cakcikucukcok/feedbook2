  <title>The Avenging Angel Part I - Andrew Matthew Spangler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The summary of this book is very simple and clear cut to me and I hope to make a clear point to all of my readers. There are some very serious and real situations that have become a problem in society today that need to be addressed urgently. First and foremost is Human Trafficking. All of us, my self included, are at risk everyday of the dangers of being abducted and held for ransom, sold, traded or trained and caged like animals for the pleasure and enjoyment of others who find themselves above the law. Those individuals, who believe it is ok to steal, trade and/ or sell Human Life, as though its some kind of commodity. Another major issue we face in society today is what some call polygamy, which I myself consider multi-partner marriages. Polygamy is the vulgar and accurate term for the sick individuals who hypnotize others into false and unscrupulous acts of lifestyle. On the other hand, Multi-partner marriages are in a category of there own, completely different than how some men in this country choose to act and distort the true meaning of marriage and being the head of a household. 
Accompany me into the true definition of real love and affection for others, along with the dramatized effects of what vigilante Justice will change and possibly stop entirely if taken into the hands of those affected by the very unusual and cruel acts of human behavior. Eye 4 won refuse to stand by and watch it continue to happen in society around me. While the true predators distort and tangle the real meaning of true compassion. This is not what God intended us to do to less aggressive or more vulnerable people in the world for our own financial, personal or political gain. Join me in my journey to bring awareness to the public about the problems at hand and help put a stop to our loved ones falling victim to the predators at large today. Along side finding those missing today from our lives we once shared and continue to hold so close to our hearts in hopes of their eventual safe return." />
