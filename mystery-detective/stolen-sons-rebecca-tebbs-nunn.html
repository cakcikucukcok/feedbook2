  <title>Stolen Sons - Rebecca Tebbs Nunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Stolen Sons&lt;/i&gt; is a retreat to the bosom of the old South with its mansions, estates, plantations, beautiful women, gala balls, delicious foods, and life at a slower pace.  Readers will delight in the courtship of Leila, aged twenty, and Louis, aged sixty, and the love shared by Hannah and John, Leila&#39;s parents.  Against a Southern backdrop and interwoven with the love story, there is tragedy-the first-born sons of the Fox family are meeting violent deaths, one after another.  Members of the family must discover what is causing the deaths in an effort to prevent more.  Are they the result of an ancient Indian curse placed on Hannah&#39;s father Rainbow by his aunt Pale Dove?  How can the Fox family negate the curse?  Is there an antidote?  Readers will become so intrigued with this family that loves, laughs, cries, mourns, and betrays one another that they will feel they are related to the characters.  In the tradition of the old South, the reader will become &quot;a first cousin, once-removed.&quot;" />
