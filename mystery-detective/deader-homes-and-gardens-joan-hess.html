  <title>Deader Homes and Gardens - Joan Hess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Claire Malloy discovers that house-hunting can be murder--literally--in the latest entry in Joan Hess&#39;s &quot;wildly entertaining series.&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Mystery Scene&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back from her somewhat unusual honeymoon, Claire Malloy must face the harsh reality of life with her new husband, police chief Peter Rosen, and her teenage daughter Caron--three people simply can&#39;t fit into her cosy two bedroom apartment. After a week of fruitless looking, she finally finds the perfect&lt;br&gt;place--a well preserved large house on a large plot of land in an area called Hollow Valley. There are only a few problems. Such as the real estate agent disappeared mid-showing and hasn&#39;t been seen since. And the last owner died in circumstances labeled &#39;accidental&#39; but were actually both &#39;mysterious&#39; and &#39;dubious&#39;. The family that owned the estate is now suing the lover of the dead owner over the rights to the property. Oh, and it isn&#39;t really for sale. When the previous owner&#39;s lover dies practically at her feet, Claire decides to take matters into her own hands. After all, to get the house of her dreams, first she has to find a killer. And all&#39;s fair in love, war, and real estate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
