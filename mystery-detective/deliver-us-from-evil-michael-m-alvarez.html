  <title>Deliver Us from Evil - Michael M. Alvarez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Nick hears about the dead man found in the desert, he doesn&#39;t give it much thought. Only thirty minutes from the Mexican border, corpses have a funny way of turning up in the strangest places.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But this is no ordinary corpse. The dead man&#39;s driver&#39;s license says he is 44 years old, but the medical examiner claims the body is that of a man named Alex Dodson in his 90&#39;s. Why the age discrepancy?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Dodson&#39;s research was intended to study the effects of the progeria disease, in hopes of finding a way to arrest the process. But Dodson inadvertently creates a terrifying new biological weapon, which certain parties will do anything to get their hands on.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Nick realizes it, he&#39;s hot on the trail of a vicious killer, is sidetracked by a beautiful female homicide detective, and is almost killed by a KGB agent who never heard of &lt;i&gt;glasnost.&lt;/I&gt; In order to recover the lethal bio-weapon and save the city from a disease deadlier than AIDS, Nick must stay alive long enough to find out who really killed Alex Dodson and solve the medical mystery of the century.&lt;/p&gt;" />
