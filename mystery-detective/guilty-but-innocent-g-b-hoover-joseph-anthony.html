  <title>Guilty but Innocent - G. B. Hoover, Joseph Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;People go to jail because they have committed crimes but a very few of those incarcerated really are innocent. Sid Brown was found guilty of murder but he was convicted even before he went to trial because he was stubborn and refused to condemn himself for a crime that he did not commit. Contradictory statements and a fatal loss of control in the witness box sealed his fate despite the best efforts of the homicide detectives, his lawyer and even the offer of a plea bargain by the prosecutor. This perfect legal storm combined to condemn and incarcerate an innocent man who could not be proven innocent until it was too late.
