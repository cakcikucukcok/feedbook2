  <title>Alias - Miguel Cassaderia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PROLOGUE
Everybody will tell a lie in certain situations, whether by mistake or on purpose. It doesnt matter what their position or status is at the time. Presidents, politicians, policemen, clergy, spouses, fiancs, friends, and even children create lies in situations to escape something. The word alias, when viewed as an acronym, breaks down the true meaning of hiding the truth. A-L-I-A-S; A Lie In A Situation. Everybody tells one!
Michael Cassaderia, a self centered 62 African American popular basketball player, and recent graduate of the University of South Florida in Tampa, discovers that although a man can be content with one woman in a relationship, the right woman with the right persistence at the right time can penetrate a solid foundation and vice-versa. College women, especially sorority sisters like Shannon Munroe, Trish Allen, Sophia Reyes, and Rosita Crews are experts at creating a lie in a situation; an alias story. Unfortunately, vulnerable men are often their targets. While Michael succumbs to their tactics and devises his own lie to go incognito and rendezvous with Sophia, his lonely, neglected, and often abandoned fiance, Chantel Prasad, generates her own unique little lie to catch up with an ex-boyfriend. Whats good for the goose becomes great for the gander! Any man who lies and misleads his woman to cheat on her deserves to be lied to and cheated on. But, the real question isCan he take it?" />
