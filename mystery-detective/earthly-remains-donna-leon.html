  <title>Earthly Remains - Donna Leon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Donna Leon bestselling mystery novels have won a multitude of fans for their insider&amp;#8217;s portrayal of Venice. From family meals to vaporetti rides, the details and rhythms of everyday life are an integral part of this beloved series. But so are the never-ending influx of tourists and the suffocating corruption. Through it all, Leon&amp;#8217;s Commissario Guido Brunetti, a good man who loves his family and his city, has been an enduring figure, but in &lt;I&gt;Earthly Remains&lt;/I&gt;, Brunetti&amp;#8217;s endurance is tested more than ever before. During an interrogation, Brunetti acts rashly, doing something he quickly comes to regret, and in the fallout, he realizes that he needs a break.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Granted leave from the Questura, Brunetti&amp;#8217;s wife Paola ships him off to a villa owned by a wealthy relative on Sant&amp;#8217;Erasmo, one of the largest islands in the laguna. There he intends to pass his days rowing, and his nights reading Pliny&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;Natural History&lt;/I&gt;. The recuperative stay goes according to plan until David Casati, the caretaker of the house, goes missing following a sudden storm. Now, Brunetti feels compelled to investigate, to set aside his leave of absence and understand what happened to the man who had become his friend.&lt;/div&gt;" />
