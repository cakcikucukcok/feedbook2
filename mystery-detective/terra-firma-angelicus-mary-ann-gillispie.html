  <title>Terra Firma Angelicus - Mary Ann Gillispie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Though fictional, Terra Firma Angelicus is based on historical documentation, and attempts to reveal the activities of the spiritual beings in the invisible realm, who influence the affairs of mankind. The names I have chosen for these invisible characters are allegorical, derived from the Latin, Greek or Hebrew languagea name that best depicts their expertise.
	You will meet two 21st century families in their personal struggles, who are also caught up in espionage, nation takeover schemes, and media propaganda attempting to implement a New World Order that will enslave all the toadies of the world, while systematically and strategically removing any semblance of the name of Jesus Christ and His Bible from the public consciousness. These global rulers know that Jesus Christ is the only enemy that must be defeated, before they can obtain total control of the mind of every human being.
	Graphically portrayed, you will see the daily involvement of the angelic and demonic entities of the invisible realm in the lives of all human beings on planet earth.
	Hopefully, this story will not simply acquaint you, but also educate you regarding the real power source of our everyday earthly life. Are you really in control of your own lifeoris someone else?" />
