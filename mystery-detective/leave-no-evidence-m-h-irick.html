  <title>Leave No Evidence - M.H. Irick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a compelling novel that causes one to think about daily routines. Ironically, the main character, Doug Donovan, lands in unusual circumstances leaving everyone around him highly vulnerable. Quite curiously in the midst of unraveling scandalous events he finds himself next on the killers list, but why? Realizing he is caught up in a dangerous and twisted MURDER for MONEY scheme...it may be too late to escape villainous intents.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At a pivotal point, Donovan is reminded of a Scottish adage his great uncle taught him, To ignore the danger is to deserve the disaster. This advice becomes his maxim to wisdom for using good since and logic. Yet, while holding devout to his faith within the crossroads of trouble, the situation begs for a holy intervention.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The story evolved after a true preternatural event occurred. The author surprisingly heard about her cousin, Sarahs son, whod received a set of keys that had once fit the locks to an authentic U.K. castle. The keys from the family ancestor, Uncle Cecil, had become the boys treasured gift. Curiously, after his unexpected demise, one of the keys had been paranormally movedmore than once. This incident prompted Marilyn to compile a riveting narrative that fashioned her first novel, Leave No Evidence.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In her debut novel, M. H. Irick tells an absorbing story that has the potential to become a sought-after summer page-turner. Leave No Evidence islike the fusing of a Maeve Binchy novel and a mystery by J.D. Robb.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; ForeWord Clarion Reviews&lt;/p&gt;" />
