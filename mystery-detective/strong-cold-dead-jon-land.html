  <title>Strong Cold Dead - Jon Land</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Texas Ranger Caitlin Strong returns in Jon Land&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Strong Cold Dead&lt;/i&gt;, a thriller with heart-stopping action and a high-stakes terrorist plot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terrorist organization ISIS is after a deadly toxin that could be the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. The same toxin holds the potential to eradicate cancer. There is a frantic race to see who can get to it first, even as Caitlin Strong begins to assemble the disparate pieces of a deadly puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of that puzzle is an Indian reservation where a vengeful tycoon is mining the toxin, disguising his effort as an oil-drilling operation. This is the same reservation where Caitlin&#39;s great-great-grandfather, also a Texas Ranger, once waged a similar battle against the forces of John D. Rockefeller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her highest-stakes adventure yet, Caitlin Strong faces off against a host of adversaries that just might include the beautiful Comanche girl with whom the son of her ex-outlaw boyfriend Cort Wesley Masters has fallen in love, along with a mythic monster culled from Native American folklore that the tribe believes has risen to protect its land. The lives of those Caitlin loves most are threatened by the villains she&#39;s pursuing; her own moral code is challenged. The fate of both the country and the state she loves is dangling on the precipice of a strong cold death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
