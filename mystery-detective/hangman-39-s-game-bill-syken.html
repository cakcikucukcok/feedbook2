  <title>Hangman&#39;s Game - Bill Syken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After losing his starting position as a college quarterback to a shoulder injury, Nick Gallow has remade himself as a punter. Now in his fifth year in the pros with the Philadelphia Sentinels, Nick spends most of his time on the sidelines. He no longer makes winning plays, and when the team visits a hospital, the sick kids would rather talk to the players they&#39;ve actually heard of. But Nick is unexpectedly thrust back into the spotlight when he witnesses the murder of the new all-star draft pick on the eve of the team&#39;s summer minicamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick has no plans to get involved. Despite the murder, his focus is squarely on an uppity rookie player eyeing his roster spot. But after a second attack hits closer to home and the police go after the wrong man, Nick finds himself driven by the chance to be a hero again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hangman&#39;s Game&lt;/i&gt;, Syken offers a seasoned sportswriter&#39;s take on the contemporary culture of football and the will to play on despite the game&#39;s toll on the body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
