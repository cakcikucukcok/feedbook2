      <meta name="description" content="My name is Oliver turner. One minute I had it allthe perfect job, the perfect fiance, and the perfect lifeand the next minute, I woke up in a desert with no money, no identity, and no clue as to how I got there. 
Oliver Turner is a twenty-six-year-old who is madly in love with his work, family, and fiance. After a short while of making friends and taking on responsibilities at the job he had worked so hard to get, he finds himself on top of the world. Before he can get accustomed to his new life, everything gets taken from him in an instant. 
In the middle of a very intense meeting, Oliver shuts his eyes for a brief moment, and when he opens them, he finds himself in a strange wasteland with nothing but misery and bloodshed for company. Can Oliver find his way back home before he loses his sanity, or will all be lost?" />
