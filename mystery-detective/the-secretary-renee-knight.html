  <title>The Secretary - Renee Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ren&amp;#233;e Knight follows up her international sensation &lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt; with this shivery tale of psychological suspense, featuring a character as disturbing and compelling as Mrs. Danvers in Daphne Du Maurier&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Rebecca.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From her first day as Personal Assistant to the celebrated Mina Appleton, Christine Butcher understands what is expected of her. Absolute loyalty. Absolute discretion. For twenty years, Christine has been a most devoted servant, a silent witness to everything in Mina&amp;#8217;s life. So quiet, you would hardly know she is there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day after day, year after year, Christine has been there, invisible&amp;#8212;watching, listening, absorbing all the secrets floating around her. Keeping them safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine is trusted. But those years of loyalty and discretion come with a high price. And eventually Christine will pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, it would be a mistake to underestimate such a steadfast woman. Because as everyone is about to discover, there&amp;#8217;s a dangerous line between obedience and obsession.&lt;/p&gt;" />
