  <title>Sorrow Road - Julia Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1944, three young men from a small town in West Virginia are among the American forces participating in D-Day, changing the fortunes of the war with one bold stroke. How is that moment aboard a Navy ship as it barrels toward the Normandy shore related to the death of an old man in an Appalachian nursing home seventy-two years later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sorrow Road&lt;/i&gt;, the latest mystery from Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Julia Keller, two stories--one set in the turbulent era of World War II and one in the present day--are woven together to create a piercingly poignant tale of memory and family, of love and murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell Elkins, prosecuting attorney in Acker&#39;s Gap, West Virginia, is asked by an old acquaintance to look into the death of her beloved father in an Alzheimer&#39;s care facility. Did he die of natural causes--or was something more sinister to blame? And that&#39;s not the only issue with which Bell is grappling: Her daughter Carla has moved back home. But something&#39;s not right. Carla is desperately hiding a secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, past and present, good and evil, and revenge and forgiveness clash in a riveting story set in the shattered landscape of Acker&#39;s Gap, where the skies can seem dark even at high noon, and the mountains lean close to hear the whispered lament of the people trapped in their shadow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
