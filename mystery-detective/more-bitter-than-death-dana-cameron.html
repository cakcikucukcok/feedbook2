  <title>More Bitter Than Death - Dana Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a deadly winter for archaeologist Emma Fielding as she tracks a killer in an old New Hampshire hotel, in this fifth mystery from real-life archaeologist Dana Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologist Emma Fielding should be on top of the world. Her teaching job secure and home life stable, she arrives at an archaeological conference at a famous old New Hampshire hotel, having outrun the winter storm that&#39;s paralysing the East Coast. A rising star in the field, she&#39;s in the midst of friends she&#39;s known all her life, celebrating the work of Professor Garrison, a venerable legend in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;When Garrison is found dead on the iced-over lake outside the snow-bound hotel, however, Emma realizes that everyone has something to hide, including herself. While the police determine whether Garrison&#39;s death was an accident, suicide, or murder, Emma&#39;s intimate knowledge of her colleagues hasn&#39;t prepared her for what they&#39;re concealing, even from themselves. Emma is also forced to face the fact that the dead man was no friend of hers (or her grandfather Oscar) and that everyone-colleagues, police, and herself included-wonders why her view of him is so very different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of Emma&#39;s old flame Duncan brings up bitter memories she&#39;d rather were left buried deep in the past: Duncan wants something from her and Emma can&#39;t tell whether it is an opportunity to rekindle their relationship or a way to ensure her silence permanently. Professional jealousies and infighting would be enough added to Garrison&#39;s mysterious death, but a series of thefts and attacks in the isolated hotel make the stranded archaeologists ask whether a vengeful ghost has returned, practiced criminals are targeting the conference, or one of their own number has finally succumbed to an array of deadly temptations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
