  <title>The Truth Won&#39;t Help Them Now - Joan Hunter, Steven Cobos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1939 when the bullet-riddled body of an accounting clerk from a gambling ship washes up under the Santa Monica pier. As city homicide detectives tenaciously chase down their only cluea fast, expensive, and very exclusive Bugattitheir investigation leads them into a tangle of competing gangsters all looking to muscle their way to a bigger share of illegal gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Los Angeles County deputy district attorney Cliff Thoms is leading a special squad searching for a pair of serial killers who have already killed four young women and are on the hunt for more. Thoms, with the help of a self-proclaimed psychic he doesnt quite trust, risks lives and careers in a desperate gamble to catch his elusive quarry. As the two investigations collide and rush to a deadly conclusion, dirty cops, DAs on the take, mobsters, grieving families, and reformer politicians must attempt to distinguish lies from the truth. Unfortunately, they are all about to discover that even the truth wont help them now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fast-paced tale of murder and gangland intrigue, a gritty district attorney and a band of detectives set out on a quest to solve two separate crimes amid a corrupted 1939 Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
