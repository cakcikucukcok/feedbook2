  <title>The Find - Rainer Rey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The nation is safe. Its people are surviving. But at what cost and for how long? Piecing together the remnants of a defunct psychic research program, a brilliant but heinous anti-terrorist group searches for unique candidates, employing a government black ops force to hunt and enlist individuals predisposed with psychic abilities. In pursuit of two very different missing persons, ex-FBI man Kellen Rand and broadcast executive Lorna Novak merge unexpectedly in a race to find answers, revealing difficult truths along the way. As Lorna searches for her abducted twelve-year-old niece, Kellen tracks down a missing Indian Shaman named January, whose exceptional abilities may be the key to saving millions of lives. Trampling civil rights for the sake of the nation&#39;s survival, this &quot;end justifies the means&quot; conspiracy is delicately intertwined with January&#39;s fascination with an elusive hidden relic hidden for centuries somewhere in the San Juan Islands - a relic that may have shocking universal significance. With their paths colliding once more and their lives rapidly transforming, Kellen and Lorna must defeat the veiled, yet powerful schemes of this brewing crisis as scientists prey on the minds of the innocent, archeologists rush to unravel an ancient mystery, and the reader, along with the rest of the world, awaits the startling revelations of The Find." />

Piecing together the remnants of a defunct psychic research program, a brilliant but heinous anti-terrorist group searches for unique candidates, employing a government black ops force to hunt and enlist individuals predisposed with psychic abilities. In pursuit of two very different missing persons, ex-FBI man Kellen Rand and broadcast executive Lorna Novak merge unexpectedly in a race to find answers, revealing difficult truths along the way. As Lorna searches for her abducted twelve-year-old niece, Kellen tracks down a missing Indian Shaman named January, whose exceptional abilities may be the key to saving millions of lives. Trampling civil rights for the sake of the nation's survival, this "end justifies the means" conspiracy is delicately intertwined with January's fascination with an elusive hidden relic hidden for centuries somewhere in the San Juan Islands - a relic that may have shocking universal significance.
