  <title>Hallowed Illusions - Donna M. Quick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Phillip Collier is a man haunted by the woman in his dreams. She&#39;s beautiful, tempting, and self-assured in her affect on the opposite sex. Phillip&#39;s dreams are just the thing his grandfather, a retired Fundamentalist minister, has been praying for. It must be a sign from God for Phillip to give up his sinning ways. Pastor is ecstatic about the woman even if she is only a figment of his grandson&#39;s imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
Imagine Phillip&#39;s astonishment when he sees a sixty-year-old portrait of a woman named Audrey Russell who&#39;s a dead ringer for the woman in his dreams. But Phillip has a bigger problem than trying to make Pastor understand why he&#39;s not romantically interested in women. Not only is he trying to figure out what makes his grandmother panic with near hysteria when she sees Audrey&#39;s portrait, he&#39;s wondering why a band of gypsies has suddenly become so treacherous.&lt;/p&gt;
When the bunch of gypsies is caught beating up Keven, Phillip&#39;s life partner, the Collier family uncovers a gypsy curse that is more than just a threat. Is the Collier family the target of evil gypsy lore that promises punishment for past transgressions and the lies of hallowed illusions?&lt;/p&gt;" />
