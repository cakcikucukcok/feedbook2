  <title>Trick Soldier - L. Ron Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Lieutenant Flint is hard-edged and muscle-bound, radiating machismo. Captain Turner is a Trick Soldier&amp;mdash;smart and at attention. They&amp;rsquo;re polar opposites&amp;mdash;like Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox in Casualties of War. They didn&amp;rsquo;t get along in boot camp, and ten years later nothing has changed. But now is the time for heroes to rise and cowards to fall. And when brute strength confronts military honor, the true measure of a man is not in his fists, but in his heart.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;A First Sergeant with the 20th United  States Marine Corps Reserve, Hubbard knew exactly what it meant to be a  Marine. As he wrote in 1935: &amp;ldquo;Most of the fiction written about  [Marines] is of an intensely dramatic type, all do-or-die and Semper  Fidelis.&amp;rdquo; But the reality, he said, was far different. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve known the  Corps from Quantico to Peiping, from the South Pacific to the West  Indies, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen any flag-waving. The most refreshing part of  the U.S.M.C. is that they get their orders . . . and do the job and  that&amp;rsquo;s that.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s that kind of unique and pointed insight that he  brings to stories like Trick Soldier.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also includes the  military adventures He Walked to War, in which Marine Sergeant E.Z. Go  appears to take it easy, but always gets the job done . . . even if it&amp;rsquo;s  hard as nails or dangerous as hell&amp;mdash;in the end E.Z. does it; and Machine  Gun 21,000, the story of a soldier who loses a gun and faces a court  martial, but finds a way to save the day.&lt;/div&gt;" />
