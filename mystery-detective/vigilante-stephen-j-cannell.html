  <title>Vigilante - Stephen J. Cannell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;In the last novel by acclaimed producer and New York Times bestselling author Stephen J. Cannell, LAPD detective Shane Scully and his partner Sumner Hitchens investigate a crime with ties to the sometimes violent world of reality TV&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Lita Mendez was a thorn in the LAPD&#39;s side.  An aggressive police critic and gang activist, she&#39;d filed countless complaints against the department. So when she&#39;s found dead in her home, Detective Scully and his partner Hitchens fear the worst: that there&#39;s a killer in their ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the crime scene, Nixon Nash and his television crew have set up shop.  Nash is the charismatic host of a hit reality show called &quot;Vigilante TV,&quot; dedicated to beating the cops at their own game: solving murders before they can.  Now he has the murder of Lita Mendez in his sights.  He presents the detectives with a choice: either join his team, or prepare for a public takedown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Scully knows that Nash isn&#39;t the folk-hero he seems.  He will do anything in the name of self-promotion.  If a detective got in his way, would he be prepared to kill? In this new novel, Scully will have to risk everything save himself and the job he loves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
