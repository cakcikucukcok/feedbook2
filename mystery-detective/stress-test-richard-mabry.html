  <title>Stress Test - Richard Mabry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THEY MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVICT HIM, BUT THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO RUIN HIS LIFE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matt Newman thought he was leaving his life as a surgeon in private practice for a better one in academic medicine. But the kidnappers who attacked him as he left the hospital at 2 a.m. have no such plans&amp;mdash;they just want him dead. Bound and in the trunk of his car, Matt&amp;rsquo;s only thought is fleeing with his life. He does escape, but at a price: a head injury that lands him in the ICU . . . where he awakens to discover he&amp;rsquo;s being charged with murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Murray is a fiery, redheaded lawyer who swore she was done with doctors after her last relationship. But when Matt calls, she knows she can&amp;rsquo;t walk away from defending someone who is truly innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt&amp;rsquo;s career is going down the drain. His freedom and perhaps his life may be next. But with the police convinced he&amp;rsquo;s a killer and the kidnappers still trying to finish what they started, finding the truth&amp;mdash;and the faith to keep going&amp;mdash;will be the toughest stress test Matt has ever endured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a terrific read, by a surgeon who clearly knows his stuff as a doctor and his craft as a writer.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;MICHAEL PALMER,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;best-selling author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Oath of Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
