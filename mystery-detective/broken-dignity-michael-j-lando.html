  <title>Broken Dignity - Michael J. Lando</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a former adult film star, how do you rebuild a normal life when the world refuses to forget who you were? For Cristal Caprice, it seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took nearly a decade for Cristal to escape the control of a sadistic tyrant named Mason, who refused to let her leave the sex industry alive. Three years later, Cristal re-emerges with a new identity in a new home, the small town of Thornwood. There, her new neighbors and friends know her only as Bianca Nubreze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling to come to terms with her shameful past and adapt to a new life, Bianca isolates herself from the world and slowly sinks into a deep depression. As she teeters on the brink of suicide, Bianca finds acceptance and optimism in a Christian evangelist named Robyn. Even so, her new found hope in life is short-lived as her secret is exposed. Revelations about her past involvement with US Congressman Adrian Reese ignite a national media scandal, and her new life is turned inside out overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With her true identity and whereabouts exposed, Bianca becomes the towns pariah and is once again relentlessly hunted by Mason. As her life spirals out of control, her only hope for redemption lies in her new found faith in God, Robyn, and a shrewd political strategist named Tamara who will do whatever it takes to protect Congressman Reeses career  at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
