  <title>Suspects - Ted Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dan Martinez, twenty-eight, laid off from his job with a law firm in Portland, Oregon, decides to train for an off-road triathlon in rural Central Oregon. After a run, Dan comes to the back door of his childhood friend, Candy Winterpol, to find Candy&amp;rsquo;s husband, Ken, barely conscious on his deck.&amp;nbsp; Dan and Candy help Ken into the kitchen and call 911.&amp;nbsp; When Detective Breuninger of the Deschutes County Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Department arrives with the medics, Dan and Candy realize they may be charged with attacking Ken (and ultimately murdering him when he dies that afternoon). Dan arranges a criminal attorney for Candy and protects himself using what he can remember from law school, where he studied business, not criminal, law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a neighbor tells Dan he saw Dan&amp;rsquo;s father in the vicinity, Dan decides he must protect his father, as well as Candy and himself, from arrest and possible conviction. Meanwhile, Dan&amp;rsquo;s father disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan undertakes to protect Candy, his father, and himself by identifying other people who had reason to kill Ken.&amp;nbsp; He uncovers Ken&amp;rsquo;s fraudulent business practices, his bribery of public officials, his early life as a drug dealer, and his bitter relationship with his previous wife.&amp;nbsp; When Dan delivers a host of suspects to Detective Breuninger, the detective arrests Dan himself in the hope of learning what Dan is trying to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy De Santis, twenty-three, attends the funeral of her landlord (Ken) and is accosted by his sister who sees a family resemblance. Amy believes Ken might be the father for whom she never had a name.&amp;nbsp; Amy meets Dan and finds they are both training for the same triathlon.&amp;nbsp; They eventually fall in love, though Dan is wary of a girl who stands to gain from Ken&amp;rsquo;s estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan finally identifies the murderer, who attempts to kill Dan, and fights the killer in a life and death struggle deep in the Oregon forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novel is narrated in various sections by Dan, Candy, Dan&amp;rsquo;s father, Amy (Dan&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend), Detective Breuninger, and, in a letter he left behind, Ken Winterpol - the murdered man himself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
