  <title>Monsieur Pamplemousse Stands Firm - Michael Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;According to the Director of &lt;i&gt;Le Guide&lt;/i&gt;, France&#39;s premier gastronomic companion, it is high time his inspectors moved with the times and opened their ranks to the fairer sex. And who better to oversee their initiation than Monsieur Pamplemousse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the Director, normally a model of rectitude, hints that on no account must the trainee be allowed to make the grade, Monsieur Pamplemousse is suitably outraged. His indignation lasts only until he hears her name. The Director is right. The lady in question is known to be utterly unscrupulous in the use of her considerable physical charms and her permanent engagement would cause unrest among the other inspectors, not to mention unhappiness amongst their wives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other problems. Having blackmailed the Director into taking her on, why is she so insistent on staying at the Hôtel des Dunes; an out-of-the-way establishment in the Gironde, unremarked even by the Camping Club of France, let alone by any of the major guides? Certainly not because of the food, as Monsieur Pamplemousse dejectedly discovers. And why, having created a scene because she didn&#39;t get the room she wanted, should one of her first acts be to photograph the dismal interior of the hotel? When Monsieur Pamplemousse&#39;s ever-faithful bloodhound Pommes Frites is seen ambling back to the hotel carrying a suspiciously large &lt;i&gt;jambon&lt;/i&gt;, Monsieur Pamplemousse realises once again he must stand firm against the forces of crime...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A delightful comic romp amongst the sand dunes of France&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Côte d&#39;Argent&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Monsieur Pamplemousse Stands Firm&lt;/i&gt; features Michael Bond&#39;s inimitable creations Monsieur Pamplemousse and his indefatigable canine assistant Pommes Frites.&lt;/p&gt;" />
