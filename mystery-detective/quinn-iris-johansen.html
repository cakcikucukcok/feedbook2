  <title>Quinn - Iris Johansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;#1 New York Times bestselling author Iris Johansen explores the darkest corners of the human heart as forensic sculptor Eve Duncan closes in on the killer who stole her daughter so many years ago.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former Navy SEAL turned cop, Joe Quinn has seen the face of evil and knows just how deadly it can be. When he first met Eve Duncan, he never expected to fall in love with a woman whose life would be defined by her dual desires to bring home her missing daughter and discover the truth behind her disappearance---no matter how devastating. With the help of CIA agent Catherine Ling, they make a shocking discovery that sheds new light on young Bonnie&#39;s abduction and puts Quinn squarely in the crosshairs of danger. Eve&#39;s first love, John Gallo, a soldier supposedly killed in the line of duty, is very much alive---and very much a threat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotionally charged, with one shock after another, Quinn reveals the electricity of Joe and Eve&#39;s first connection, and how they fell in love in the midst of haunting tragedy. As their search takes them deeper and deeper into a web of murder and madness, Joe and Eve must confront their most primal fears . . . and test their resolve to uncover the ultimate bone-chilling truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
