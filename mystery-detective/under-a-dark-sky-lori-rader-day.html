  <title>Under a Dark Sky - Lori Rader-Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the critically-acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The Day I Died&lt;/em&gt; comes a terrifying twist on a locked-room mystery that will keep readers guessing until the last page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only in the dark can she find the truth . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her husband died, Eden Wallace&#39;s life has diminished down to a tiny pinprick, like a far-off star in the night sky. She doesn&#39;t work, has given up on her love of photography, and is so plagued by night terrors that she can&#39;t sleep without the lights on. Everyone, including her family, has grown weary of her grief. So when she finds paperwork in her husband&#39;s effects indicating that he reserved a week at a dark sky park, she goes. She&#39;s ready to shed her fear and return to the living, even if it means facing her paralyzing phobia of the dark. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when she arrives at the park, the guest suite she thought was a private retreat is teeming with a group of twenty-somethings, all stuck in the orbit of their old college friendships. Horrified that her get-away has been taken over, Eden decides to head home the next day. But then a scream wakes the house in the middle of the night. One of the friends has been murdered. Now everyone&amp;#8212;including Eden&amp;#8212;is a suspect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone is keeping secrets, but only one is a murderer. As mishaps continue to befall the group, Eden must make sense of the chaos and lies to evade a ruthless killer&amp;#8212;and she&#39;ll have to do it before dark falls&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
