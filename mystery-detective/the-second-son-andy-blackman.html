  <title>The Second Son - Andy Blackman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the second son of the Duke of Hampshire, Grenville St John Hampton isn’t likely to inherit his family’s title or estate, leaving him pondering an empty, aimless future. During the summer break from university, he impulsively decides to go backpacking with one of his oldest friends, Johnathan; their destination is Belize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One sultry night on the Central American coastline, Grenville and Johnathan meet Tom. A game of darts takes a vicious turn. Realising he has nothing to look forward to back at home, Grenville decides to stay on in Belize with Tom, in pursuit of adventure. Together, the new friends establish an import business, and for the rst time in his life, Grenville has a sense of purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But back in England all is not well. The sudden death of his brother leaves Grenville with an unexpected – and now unwanted – inheritance, with new consequences and responsibilities. He will return to claim the family’s seat with a dark secret in tow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andy Blackman is the author of For the Love of Grace (published by Clink Street, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;" />
