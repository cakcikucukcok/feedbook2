  <title>The Tavern in the Morning - Alys Clare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the end of a dark and dreary market day, Goody Anne&#39;s inn at Tonbridge is finally settling down for the night.  But while Anne&#39;s serving maid and boy finish up their chores, a man lies dying in the guest chamber-poisoned by a piece of pie made by Goody Anne herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josse d&#39;Acquin, a knight with a knack for solving mysteries, is troubled by the news of the stranger&#39;s death.  Josse has been a regular visitor to Goody Anne&#39;s, and he hates to think that Anne-or her fine cooking-has fallen suspect.  He rides off to the scene of the crime and starts his own investigation.  &lt;br&gt;When Josse discovers wolf&#39;s bane in the remnants of the pie, he knows that someone must have tampered with Anne&#39;s cooking.  And when he learns that a charming, handsome nobleman ordered a piece of that very pie, Josse is convinced that the poison was meant for this upper-class guest, and not for the poor stranger who died alone in Anne&#39;s guest chamber.&lt;br&gt;After failing to persuade the Sheriff that the death was suspicious, Josse turns to his old friend, the formidable Abbess Helewise.  Weakened from a severe bout of fever, the Abbess nonetheless provides a thread of common sense as Josse follows the trail of murder into the ancient, mysterious Wealden Forest, and finds something there that will change his life forever . . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
