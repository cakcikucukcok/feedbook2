  <title>The British Lion - Tony Schumacher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this crackling alternate history thriller set in the years after World War II&amp;#8212;the riveting sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Darkest Hour&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;London detective John Rossett joins forces with his Nazi boss to save the commander&amp;#8217;s kidnapped daughter as the Germans race to make the first atomic bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the end of the war, the victorious Germans now occupy a defeated Great Britain. In London, decorated detective John Henry Rossett, now reporting to the Nazi victors, lies in a hospital bed recovering from gunshot wounds. Desperate to avoid blame over the events that led to the shooting, his boss, Ernst Koehler, covers up the incident. But when Koehler&amp;#8217;s wife and daughter are kidnapped by American spies, the terrified German turns to the only man he trusts to help him&amp;#8212;a shrewd cop who will do whatever is necessary to get the job done: John Rossett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surviving his brush with death, Rossett agrees to save his friend&amp;#8217;s daughter. But in a chaotic new world ruled by treachery and betrayal, doing the right thing can get a man killed. Caught between the Nazi SS, the violent British resistance, and Americans with very uncertain loyalties, Rossett must secretly make his way out of London and find Ruth Hartz, a Jewish scientist working in Cambridge. Spared from death because of her intellect and expertise, she is forced to work on developing the atom bomb for Germany. Though she knows it could end any hope of freedom in Europe and maybe even the world, Ruth must finish the project&amp;#8212;if she, too, wants to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
