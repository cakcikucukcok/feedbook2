  <title>See Jane Die - Erica Spindler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nearly killed as a teenager by a hit-and-run boater, Jane Killian is a woman with everything to live for. A series of surgeries restored her lovely face. She&#39;s the toast of the Dallas art community, her sculptures lauded as both disturbing and beautiful. And Jane and her husband, plastic surgeon Dr. Ian Westbrook, are expecting their first child.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Then a woman with ties to Ian is found brutally slain and the police make him their prime suspect. At first determined to prove her husband&#39;s innocence, Jane cannot escape her own growing doubts. Then her nightmare escalates. She begins receiving anonymous messages and quickly becomes convinced they&#39;re from &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#151;the boater she always believed deliberately hit her and got away with it.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Now Jane must face a terrifying truth. Her tormentor knows everything about her&amp;#151;her likes, her dislikes, her daily routine and, most frightening of all, her deepest fears. And he will use them mercilessly until he sees Jane dead." />
