      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A vibrant vignette of the modern cruise as a symbol of globalization with its inevitable conflicts, surprising encounters and unexpected love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Sultan invites you on board, you need to accept. She is a luxurious ship sailing proudly between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. In her lounges, unscrupulous art traders have frantic conversations. In her storerooms, highly prized artwork awaits its destiny: a very private, not-so-legal auction on the ocean. Let’s go behind the velvet curtain, to the personnel’s quarters, a world of equally sharp ambitions, raging dangers, and murder.&lt;br/&gt;An idealistic musician and his beautiful partner collaborate to save art from money. But when they clash against the warped life of a pastry chef and the driven personality of the Cruise Director, these four people are thrown into a battle where the power of past and present feelings is only equaled by the force of the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cruising with Death&lt;/i&gt; is a vibrant vignette of the modern cruise as a symbol of globalization with its inevitable conflicts, surprising encounters and unexpected love.&lt;br/&gt;Set yourselves towards new horizons.

He went right to the bar.&lt;br/&gt;“Hasn’t Lupe finished yet ?”&lt;br/&gt;“She is working, leave her alone”, said Juan without raising his head.&lt;br/&gt;He served a tourist, then another and yet another. Javier glared at Lupe’s boss as if he was pushing a sword into his flesh, searching for his heart (or something similar to it). Since he didn’t find anything, he raised his glass as a threat and marched right to a table on the terrace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Katy O’Connor&lt;/b&gt; was born in Africa. She grew up in France but has also lived in Spain and in the Middle East. Presently, she lives in California with her family. Her books express her interest for all kinds of journeys and the challenge of being “from everywhere and nowhere.”" />
