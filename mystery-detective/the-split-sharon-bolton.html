She took a job on this isolated island to hide from him, but now that he&#39;s out of prison, having served a term for murder, she knows he won&#39;t give up until he finds her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a doctor delving into the background of Felicity and Freddie&#39;s relationship, back in Cambridge, learns that Felicity has been on the edge for a long time. Heading to South Georgia himself to try and get to her first is the only way he can think of to help her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
