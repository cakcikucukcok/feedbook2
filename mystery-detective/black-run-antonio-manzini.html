  <title>Black Run - Antonio Manzini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Already an international hit, a sly, sizzling mystery&amp;#8212;the first in a sensational crime series&amp;#8212;set in the Italian Alps, reminiscent of the works of Andrea Camilleri, D. A. Mishani, Donna Leon, and Henning Mankell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting into serious trouble with the wrong people, deputy prefect of police Rocco Schiavone is exiled to Aosta, a small, touristy alpine town far from his beloved Rome. The sophisticated and crotchety Roman despises mountains, snow, and the provincial locals as much as he disdains his superiors and their petty rules. But he loves solving crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mangled body has been discovered on a ski run above Champoluc, Rocco immediately faces his first challenge&amp;#8212;identifying the victim, a complex procedure complicated by his ignorance of the customs, dialect, and history of his new home. Proud and undaunted, Rocco makes his way among the ski runs, mountain huts, and aerial tramways, meeting ski instructors, Alpine guides, the hardworking, enigmatic folk of Aosta, and a few beautiful locals eager to give him a warm welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t be easy, this mountain life, especially with a corpse or two in the mix. But then there&amp;#39;s nothing that makes Rocco feel more at home than an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An insightful observer of human nature, Antonio Manzini writes with sly humor and a dash of irony, and introduces an irresistible hero&amp;#8212;a fascinating blend of swagger, machismo, and vulnerability&amp;#8212;in a colorful and atmospheric crime mystery series that is European crime fiction at its best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
