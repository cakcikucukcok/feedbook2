  <title>Murder Carries a Torch - Anne George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Though unalike as snowflakes, sisters Patricia Anne and Mary Alice share a sympathetic heart for their distraught cousin Luke -- known affectionately in his boyhood as &quot;Pukey Lukey,&quot; because of his penchant for getting sick in moving vehicles. Luke is desperate to hunt down Virginia, his wife of forty years, who has run off with a housepainter/snake-handling preacher named &quot;Monk.&quot; And the sisters have graciously agreed to accompany their stricken kinsman on his search...in Luke&#39;s car, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;But, while practical &quot;Mouse&quot; and flamboyant &quot;Sister&quot; are unable to find their runaway cousin-in-law among the asp-loving faithful on Chandler Mountain, they do manage to stumble upon the corpse of a pretty young redhead who was prematurely sent to her eternal reward. And before you can say &quot;anaconda,&quot; they are hot on the serpentine trail of a killer who&#39;d like nothing better than to sink a pair of poisonous fangs into two meddling Southern sisters!&lt;/p&gt;" />
