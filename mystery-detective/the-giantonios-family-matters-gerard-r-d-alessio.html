  <title>The Giantonios: Family Matters - Gerard R. D’Alessio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gennero Giantonio is a powerful man who is accustomed to being in control of every situation. But life is not treating him with the respect he is accustomed to, and its throwing him into a spin at the pinnacle of his very successful career. Upset and questioning whether the unexpected death of his grandson, Richie, was from an accidental overdose, as the police have determined, he needs to understand exactly what happened on that fateful day. He enlists the help of Grady, a volatile musician friend of Richies, to help him get to the truth, no matter how disturbing it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grip of his grief, Gennero must also deal with two tragedies in his immediate family: his beloved sister, Maria, has recently learned that she has cancer. And, Tessie, his wife of fifty-five years has become delusional and paranoid, a situation he is in no way prepared to handle. Gennero is uncharacteristically lost as his carefully regulated life is quickly spinning out of control. For the first time in his life, he feels confused and overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Gennero is coping with these family problems, Grady uncovers the mystery of Richies death, and in the process, solves important issues in his own life, including those which have been interfering with his developing a deeper relationship with his girlfriend, Karen. This suspenseful psychological family drama takes place during one fast-paced and hectic week.&lt;/p&gt;" />
