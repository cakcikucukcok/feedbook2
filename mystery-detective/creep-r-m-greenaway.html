  <title>Creep - R.M. Greenaway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Leith and Dion are on the hunt for a different kind of murderer … and he’s a real animal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Days before Halloween, a pair of hikers come across a body in the old-growth forest of the Lynn Valley Headwaters parklands. But it looks like a simple heart attack, and hardly seems like a police matter …&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Until a week later, when a body in a duffel bag is recovered from the crawlspace of a derelict home. It looks like the victim was killed by dogs, but something about the case just seems wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Once an up-and-coming plainclothes star with the North Shore RCMP, these days Constable Cal Dion is coping with depression and back on general duties. Out on the periphery of the murder investigation, he feels it would be safe enough to ask a witness out for a drink, surely …&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Constable David Leith, on the other hand, is in the thick of a case complicated by rumour and whispers. Halloween isn’t only bringing out the ghouls. People are starting to think there’s a werewolf on the loose — and the killer seems to agree." />
