  <title>Sidney Sheldon&#39;s A Silent Widow - Sidney Sheldon, Tilly Bagshawe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SHELDON LEGACY:&lt;/b&gt; The late novelist and screenwriter Sidney Sheldon remains one of the world’s top bestselling authors, having sold more than 300 million copies of his books. He is the only writer to have won an Oscar, a Tony, and an Edgar Award. &lt;i&gt;The Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/i&gt; cites him as the most translated author in the world. Famous for his fast-paced plots, strong heroines, and unexpected twists, Sidney Sheldon is also one of Tilly Bagshawe’s all time favorite writers. A bestselling author in her own right, Tilly now takes up the official mantle of this late, great author, writing in his inimitable Sheldon style.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRAND NAME AUTHOR:&lt;/b&gt; With a huge backlist of bestselling titles and a large fanbase, readers, librarians, and booksellers know and love Sidney Sheldon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;RAVE REVIEWS:&lt;/b&gt; From &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, Tilly Bagshawe and Sidney Sheldon have racked up some incredible praise over the years and a devoted readership.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;NEW PUBLISHING PROGRAM:&lt;/b&gt; Even when lacking focus and energy at her previous publisher, the sales for Bagshawe’s Sheldon novels were great. Now at Crooked Lane, at the top of our list, she’ll get all of the marketing and promotional attention that she deserves and that will launch her sales to the next level.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;MANUSCRIPT AVAILABLE:&lt;/b&gt; Previously published in the UK, we’re working with a final manuscript that we’d be happy to share with anyone looking for a fun twisting, turning summer read.&lt;/div&gt;" />
